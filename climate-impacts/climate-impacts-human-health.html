	<h2 class="pane-title">Climate Change Affects Human Health</h2>

	<div class="pane-content">
		<p>In 2016, the U.S. Global Change Research Program produced a <a href="https://health2016.globalchange.gov/">report</a> that analyzed the impacts of global climate change on human health in the United States. The report finds that:</p>

		<ul><li>Climate change is a significant threat to the health of the American people.</li>
			<li>Climate change can affect human health in two main ways: first, by changing the severity or frequency of health problems that are already affected by climate or weather factors; and second, by creating unprecedented or unanticipated health problems or health threats in places or times of the year where they have not previously occurred.</li>
			<li>Every American is vulnerable to the health impacts associated with climate change, but some populations will be especially affected. These groups include the poor, some communities of color, limited English-proficiency and immigrant groups, indigenous peoples, children and pregnant women, older adults, vulnerable occupational groups, people with disabilities, and people with medical conditions.</li>
		</ul></div>
</div>

<h2><a id="Overview" name="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>

<p>The impacts of climate change include warming temperatures, changes in precipitation, increases in the frequency or intensity of some extreme weather events, and rising sea levels. These impacts threaten our health by affecting the food we eat, the water we drink, the air we breathe, and the weather we experience.</p>

<p>The severity of these health risks will depend on the ability of public health and safety systems to address or prepare for these changing threats, as well as factors such as an individual's behavior, age, gender, and economic status. Impacts will vary based on a where a person lives, how sensitive they are to health threats, how much they are exposed to climate change impacts, and how well they and their community are able to adapt to change.</p>

<p>People in developing countries may be the most vulnerable to health risks globally, but climate change poses significant threats to health even in wealthy nations such as the United States. Certain populations, such as children, pregnant women, older adults, and people with low incomes, face increased risks; see the section below on <a href="../node/153675.html#Populations of concern">Populations of Concern</a>. </p>

<h2><a id="Temperature" name="Temperature"></a>Temperature-Related Impacts</h2>

<p>Warmer average temperatures will lead to hotter days and more frequent and longer heat waves.<a href="../node/153675.html#ref2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> These changes will lead to an increase in heat-related deaths in the United States—reaching as much as thousands to tens of thousands of additional deaths each year by the end of the century during summer months.</p>

<p>These deaths will not be offset by the smaller reduction in cold-related deaths projected in the winter months.<a href="../node/153675.html#ref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> However, adaptive responses, such as wider use of air conditioning, are expected to reduce the projected increases in death from extreme heat.<a href="../node/153675.html#ref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

By the middle of this century, the coldest night of the year is projected to warm by 6&deg;F to 10&deg;F over most of the country, with slightly smaller changes in the south. The warmest day of the year is projected to be 4&deg;F to 6&deg;F warmer in most areas. Also shown are projections of the wettest day of the year (bottom left) and the annual longest consecutive dry day spell (bottom right). Extreme precipitation is projected to increase, with an average change of 5% to 15% in the precipitation falling on the wettest day of the year. The length of the annual longest dry spell is projected to increase in most areas, but these changes are small: less than two days in most areas.<sup>[1] </sup><br />

<p>Exposure to extreme heat can lead to heat stroke and dehydration, as well as cardiovascular, respiratory, and cerebrovascular disease.<sup><a href="../node/153675.html#ref3">[3]</a><a href="../node/153675.html#ref4">[4]</a></sup> Excessive heat is more likely to affect populations in northern latitudes where people are less prepared to cope with excessive temperatures. Certain types of populations are more vulnerable than others: for example, outdoor workers, student athletes, and homeless people tend to be more exposed to extreme heat because they spend more time outdoors. Low-income households and older adults may lack access to air conditioning which also increases exposure to extreme heat. Additionally, young children, pregnant women, older adults, and people with certain medical conditions are less able to regulate their body temperature and can therefore be more vulnerable to extreme heat.<a href="../node/153675.html#ref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="impactsreducedair"><a id="Air" name="Air"></a>Air Quality Impacts</h2>

<p>Changes in the climate affect the air we breathe both indoors and outdoors. Warmer temperatures and shifting weather patterns can worsen air quality, which can lead to asthma attacks and other respiratory and cardiovascular health effects.<a href="../node/153675.html#ref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Wildfires, which are expected to continue to increase in number and severity as the climate changes, create smoke and other unhealthy air pollutants.<a href="../node/153675.html#ref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Rising carbon dioxide levels and warmer temperatures also affect airborne allergens, such as <a href="../climate-indicators/ragweed-pollen-season.html">ragweed pollen</a>.</p>

<p>Despite significant improvements in U.S. air quality since the 1970s, as of 2014 about 57 million Americans lived in counties that did not meet national air quality standards.<a href="../node/153675.html#ref5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> Climate change may make it even harder for states to meet these standards in the future, exposing more people to unhealthy air.</p>

<h3><em>Increases in Ozone</em></h3>

<p>Scientists project that warmer temperatures from climate change will increase the frequency of days with unhealthy levels of ground-level ozone, a harmful air pollutant, and a component in smog.<a href="../node/153675.html#ref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<ul><li>People exposed to higher levels of ground-level ozone are at greater risk of dying prematurely or being admitted to the hospital for respiratory problems.<a href="../node/153675.html#ref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></li>
	<li>Ground-level ozone can damage lung tissue, reduce lung function, and inflame airways. This can aggravate asthma or other lung diseases. Children, older adults, outdoor workers, and those with asthma and other chronic lung diseases are particularly at risk.<a href="../node/153675.html#ref5"><sup>[5]</sup></a></li>

Source:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.arb.ca.gov/consprod/geninfo/cpsmog.htm">California Air Resources Board (2014)</a></span></span>Because warm, stagnant air tends to increase the formation of ozone, climate change is likely to increase levels of ground-level ozone in already-polluted areas of the United States and increase the number of days with poor air quality.<a href="../node/153675.html#ref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></li>
	<li>The higher concentrations of ozone due to climate change may result in tens to thousands of additional ozone-related illnesses and premature deaths per year by 2030 in the United States, assuming no change in projected air quality policies.<sup><a href="https://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/impacts/health.html#ref1">[1]</a></sup></li>
</ul><h4><em>Changes in Particulate Matter</em></h4>

<p>Particulate matter is the term for a category of extremely small particles and liquid droplets suspended in the atmosphere. Fine particles include those smaller than 2.5 micrometers (about one ten-thousandth of an inch). Some particulate matter such as dust, wildfire smoke, and sea spray occur naturally, while some is created by human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels to produce energy. These particles may be emitted directly or may be formed in the atmosphere from chemical reactions of gases such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and volatile organic compounds.</p>

<h2><a id="Vectorborne" name="Vectorborne"></a>Vectorborne Diseases</h2>

<p>Vectorborne diseases are illnesses that are transmitted by disease <em>vectors</em>, which include mosquitoes, ticks, and fleas. These vectors can carry infectious pathogens, such as viruses, bacteria, and protozoa, from animals to humans. Changes in temperature, precipitation, and extreme events increases the geographic range of diseases spread by vectors and can lead to illnesses occurring earlier in the year.</p>

<ul><li>The geographic range of ticks that carry Lyme disease is limited by temperature. As air temperatures rise, ticks are likely to become active earlier in the season, and their range is likely to continue to expand northward.<sup><a href="../node/153675.html#ref1">[1]</a></sup> Typical symptoms of <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/">Lyme disease</a> include fever, headache, fatigue, and a characteristic skin rash.</li>
	<li>Mosquitoes thrive in certain climate conditions and can spread diseases like <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/westnile/index.html">West Nile virus</a>. Extreme temperatures—too cold, hot, wet, or dry—influence the location and number of mosquitoes that transmit West Nile virus. More than three million people were estimated to be infected with West Nile virus in the United States from 1999 to 2010.<a href="../node/153675.html#ref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></li>
</ul><p>The spread of climate-sensitive diseases will depend on both climate and non-climate factors such as land use, socioeconomic and cultural conditions, pest control, access to health care, and human responses to disease risk. The United States has public health infrastructure and programs to monitor, manage, and prevent the spread of many diseases. The risks for climate-sensitive diseases can be much higher in poorer countries that have less capacity to prevent and treat illness.<a href="../node/153675.html#ref8"><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<h2><a id="Water" name="Water"></a>Water-Related Illnesses</h2>

<p>People can become ill if exposed to contaminated drinking or recreational water. Climate change increases the risk of illness through increasing temperature, more frequent heavy rains and runoff, and the effects of storms. Health impacts may include gastrointestinal illness like diarrhea, effects on the body's nervous and respiratory systems, or liver and kidney damage.<a href="../node/153675.html#ref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<ul><li>Climate impacts can affect exposure to waterborne pathogens (bacteria, viruses, and parasites such as<em>Cryptosporidium</em> and <em>Giardia</em>); toxins produced by harmful algal and cyanobacterial blooms in the water; and chemicals that end up in water from human activities.<a href="../node/153675.html#ref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></li>
	<li>Changing water temperatures mean that waterborne <em>Vibrio</em> bacteria and harmful algal toxins will be present in the water or in seafood at different times of the year, or in places where they were not previously threats.<a href="../node/153675.html#ref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></li>
	<li>Runoff and flooding resulting from increases in extreme precipitation, hurricane rainfall, and storm surge will increasingly contaminate water bodies used for recreation (<a href="http://water.epa.gov/type/oceb/beaches/health.cfm">such as lakes and beaches</a>), shellfish harvesting waters, and sources of drinking water.<a href="../node/153675.html#ref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></li>

<h2><a name="Mental health" id="Mental health"></a>Mental Health</h2>

<p>Any changes in a person's physical health or surrounding environment can also have serious impacts on their mental health.

</div>

<p>Some groups of people are more vulnerable than others to health risks from climate change.<a href="../node/153675.html#ref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Three factors contribute to vulnerability: <em>sensitivity</em>, which refers to the degree to which people or groups are affected by a stressor such as higher temperatures; <em>exposure</em>, which refers to physical contact between a person and a stressor; and <em>adaptive capacity</em>, which refers to an ability to adjust to or avoid potential hazards. For example, while older adults are sensitive to extreme heat, an older person living in an air-conditioned apartment won't be exposed as long as she stays indoors, and as long as she can afford to pay for the electricity to run the air conditioner. Her ability take these actions is a measure of her adaptive capacity.</p>

<p>Some populations are especially vulnerable to climate health risks due to particular sensitivities, high likelihood of exposure, low adaptive capacity, or combinations of these factors.</p>

<ul class="roomy"><li>Communities of color (including Indigenous communities as well as specific racial and ethnic groups), low income, immigrants, and limited English proficiency face disproportionate vulnerabilities due to a wide variety of factors, such as higher risk of exposure, socioeconomic and educational factors that affect their adaptive capacity, and a higher prevalence of medical conditions that affect their sensitivity.<a href="../node/153675.html#ref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></li>
	<li>Children are vulnerable to many health risks due to biological sensitivities and more opportunities for exposure (due to activities such as playing outdoors). Pregnant women are vulnerable to heat waves and other extreme events, like flooding.<a href="../node/153675.html#ref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></li>
	<li>Older adults are vulnerable to many of the impacts of climate change. They may have greater sensitivity to heat and contaminants, a higher prevalence of disability or preexisting medical conditions, or limited financial resources that make it difficult to adapt to impacts.<a href="../node/153675.html#ref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></li>
	<li>Occupational groups, such as outdoor workers, paramedics, firefighters, and transportation workers, as well as workers in hot indoor work environments, will be especially vulnerable to extreme heat and exposure to vectorborne diseases.<a href="../node/153675.html#ref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></li>
	<li>People with disabilities can be very vulnerable during extreme weather events, unless communities ensure that their emergency response plans specifically accommodate them.</li>
	<li>People with chronic medical conditions are typically vulnerable to extreme heat, especially if they are taking medications that make it difficult to regulate body temperature.<a href="../node/153675.html#ref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Power outages can be particularly threatening for people reliant on certain medical equipment.</li>
</ul><p class="pagetop"><a href="../node/153675.html#main-content">Top of Page</a></p>

<h2><a id="Other" name="Other"></a>Other Health Impacts</h2>

<p>Other linkages exist between climate change and human health. For example, changes in temperature and precipitation, as well as droughts and floods, will affect agricultural yields and production.<a href="../node/153675.html#ref9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> In some regions of the world, these impacts may compromise food security and threaten human health through malnutrition, the spread of infectious diseases, and food poisoning. The worst of these effects are projected to occur in developing countries, among vulnerable populations.<a href="../node/153675.html#ref8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> Declines in human health in other countries can affect the United States through trade, migration, and immigration and has implications for national security.<sup><a href="../node/153675.html#ref1">[1]</a><a href="../node/153675.html#ref4">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>Although the impacts of climate change have the potential to affect human health in the United States and around the world, there is a lot we can do to prepare for and adapt to these changes—such as establishing early warning systems for heat waves and other extreme events, taking steps to reduce vulnerabilities among populations of concern, raising awareness among healthcare professionals, and ensuring that infrastructure is built to accommodate anticipated future changes in climate. Understanding the threats that climate change poses to human health is the first step in working together to lower risks and be prepared.</p>
