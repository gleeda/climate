      <p><strong>What are we doing about black carbon?</strong></p>
      
<div class="imgcontainer-r" style="width: 201px;"><img src="https://www3.epa.gov/airquality/blackcarbon/images/glacier.jpg" alt="Image of glacier"></div><p>BC's short atmospheric lifetime (days to weeks), combined with  its strong warming potential, means that targeted strategies to reduce BC  emissions can be expected to provide climate benefits within the next several  decades.</p>
      <p>        In evaluating mitigation options, it is important to remember  that BC is emitted with other particles and gases, such as sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>),  nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>), OC and CO<sub>2</sub>. Some of these co-emitted  pollutants exert a cooling effect on climate. This has to be taken into account  in evaluating the net effect of BC mitigation options. </p>
      <p>        The net climate effect of reducing emissions from BC sources on  climate depends partly on the relative balance between BC and other co-emitted  pollutants.  Some combustion sources emit  more BC than others.  For example, the  particles emitted by mobile diesel engines are about 75% BC, while particle  emissions from biomass burning are dominated by OC.  Reductions in emissions from BC-rich sources  have the greatest likelihood of providing climate benefits. </p>
      <p>Mitigation actions for BC will produce different climate results  depending on the region, season, and sources in the area where emissions  reductions occur.</p>
<p id="US"><strong>Key U.S. Programs</strong><br>
  <u>Mobile</u><br>
U.S. mobile source BC emissions are projected to decline by 86%  by 2030 due to regulations already promulgated. <br>
BC emissions from mobile diesel engines (including on-road, nonroad,  locomotive, and commercial marine engines) in the United States are being  controlled through two primary mechanisms: </p>
<div class="imgcontainer-r" style="width: 300px;"><img src="https://www3.epa.gov/airquality/blackcarbon/images/Diesel-Truck.jpg"></div><ul>
  <li>emissions standards  for new engines, including requirements resulting in use of diesel particulate  filters (DPFs) in conjunction with ultra low sulfur diesel fuel; and </li>
  <li>retrofit programs for  in-use mobile diesel engines, such as <a href="https://www.epa.gov/diesel/">EPA&rsquo;s National Clean Diesel Campaign</a>  and the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/smartway/">SmartWay  Transport Partnership Program</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>New engine requirements have resulted in a 32% reduction in BC  emissions from U.S. mobile sources between 1990 and 2005. As vehicles and  engines meeting new regulations are phased into the fleet, a further 86%  reduction in BC emissions from mobile sources is projected from 2005 to 2030,  leading to a total decline of 90% in BC emissions between 1990 and 2030. Such  regulations have been effective in reducing emissions of BC from on-road  vehicles (mainly diesel trucks), and nonroad diesel engines, locomotives, and  commercial marine vessels.  Read more details on  <a href="https://www.epa.gov/otaq/standards/allstandards.htm">EPA&rsquo;s regulatory requirements for mobile sources</a></p>
<p>  Most of the mobile source reductions are concentrated in the  diesel fleet, which is responsible for 93% of mobile source BC emissions.  Reductions can be achieved via application of  diesel particulate filters (DPFs) combined with ultra low sulfur diesel fuel.  DPFs typically eliminate more than 90% of diesel PM and can reduce BC by as  much as 99%.</p>
<p>  Diesel retrofits for in-use engines can achieve additional BC  emissions reductions to complement new engine regulations.  There are currently available, cost-effective  diesel retrofit strategies that can reduce harmful emissions from in-use  engines substantially. EPA&rsquo;s National Clean Diesel Campaign has provided grant  funds to support diesel engine retrofits, repowers, and replacements.</p>
<p><u>Industrial</u><br>
  Regulations limiting direct emissions of particles (including  BC) affect more than 40 categories of industrial sources in the United States,  including coke ovens, cement plants, industrial boilers, and stationary diesel  engines.  While these standards and  emission limits are not targeted toward BC emissions specifically, they are  clearly having a positive impact on reducing these emissions. </p>
<p>  Analysis of historical data indicates that controls on  industrial sources, combined with improvements in technology and broader  deployment of cleaner fuels such as natural gas, have helped reduce U.S. black  carbon emissions more than 70% since the early 1900s.  </p>
<p> Available control technologies and strategies include direct PM<sub>2.5</sub>  reduction technologies such as fabric filters (baghouses), electrostatic  precipitators (ESPs), and diesel particulate filters (DPFs).</p>
<p><div class="imgcontainer-r" style="width: 200px;"><img src="https://www3.epa.gov/airquality/blackcarbon/images/old-stove.jpg"></div><u>Residential</u>
  <p>Emissions of all pollutants from residential wood combustion  (RWC) are currently being evaluated as part of EPA&rsquo;s ongoing review of  emissions standards for residential wood heaters, including hydronic heaters,  woodstoves, and furnaces. <br>
    Mitigation options include providing alternatives to wood,  replacing inefficient units or retrofitting existing units.  Visit <a href="https://www.epa.gov/burnwise/">EPA's Burn Wise website</a> for more information.</p>
  </p>
  <p>    <u>Open Biomass Burning</u><br>
    Open biomass burning, including both prescribed fires and  wildfires, represents a potentially large but less certain portion of the U.S.  BC inventory. These sources emit much larger amounts of OC compared to BC. The  percent of land area affected by different types of burning is uncertain, as  are emissions estimates. Wildfires account for approximately 68% of BC  emissions from open biomass burning in the United States, although this varies  significantly from year to year.  
  </p>
  <p>  Appropriate mitigation measures depend on the timing and  location of burning, resource management objectives, vegetation type, and  available resources. For wildfires, expanding domestic fire prevention efforts  may help to reduce BC emissions.</p>
<p id="Intl"><strong>International Efforts</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Climate and Clean Air  Coalition:  </strong>On February 16, 2012, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton announced  the Climate and Clean Air Coalition to Reduce Short-Lived Climate Pollutants, a  new global initiative to seize the opportunity of realizing concrete benefits  on climate, health, food and energy resulting from reducing short-lived climate  pollutants. The coalition will focus efforts on reducing black carbon,  hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and methane. The founding coalition partners are  Bangladesh, Canada, Ghana, Mexico, Sweden, and the United States, together with  the UN Environment Programme.  For more  information, see:  <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2012/02/184055.htm">http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2012/02/184055.htm</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Long Range Trans-boundary  Air Pollution:</strong> An Ad Hoc Expert  Group on Black Carbon was initiated to assess the available information on  black carbon and articulate a rationale for addressing near-term and  regional/Arctic climate change impacts of air pollution along with impacts on  human health and ecosystems.&nbsp; The Group concluded that there is general  consensus that mitigation of BC will lead to positive regional impacts by  reducing BC deposition in areas with snow and ice. There is also general  consensus that reducing primary PM will benefit public health. Less certain are  the direction and magnitude of the global radiative forcing associated with BC. </p>
