<h3>March 12, BMDS - News Announcement #1 - Version 1.4.1 Release</h3>

<p>A new version of EPA's benchmark dose software, BMDS 1.4.1, is now available. BMDS 1.4.1 contains several improvements over version 1.3.2, including improved compatibility with the latest Windows operating systems, a new Multistage-cancer model, greater speed and reliability and an improved output format for all models.</p>

<hr /><p><a name="02" id="02"></a></p>



<h3>September 3, BMDS - News Announcement #2 - Version 1.4.1b Release</h3>

<p>BMDS Version 1.4.1b is now available. This version contains an updated BMDS help file. It can be downloaded from the BMDS website. Installation of this new version over the version that currently exists on your computer will not delete any existing BMDS datasets or output files.    </p>

<p>LOOK FOR NEW BMDS VERSION 2.0 BETA AND NEW BMDS TRAINING MATERIALS LATER THIS MONTH. Sometime in September, 2007 EPA NCEA will make available BMDS 2.0 beta, which will offer several new dichotomous models and an expanded interface with many new features that facilitate running and comparing multiple model and dataset combinations. Also, a complete set of upgraded and voice narrated BMDS training materials will be available in the month of September. You will receive an announcement similar to this one when these new materials and upgrades are available, or you can visit the EPA BMDS website to periodically check for new downloads and news items.</p>

<hr /><p><a name="03" id="03"></a></p>



<h3>September 28, BMDS - News Announcement #3 - Version 2.0 Beta Release</h3>

<p>BMDS Version 2.0 beta is now available. Today, NCEA's BMDS website has been updated to add the new, beta-test BMDS 2.0. BMDS 2.0 employs a new, markedly improved user interface and has enhanced batch processing capabilities with many new features that facilitate running and comparing multiple model and dataset combinations. BMDS 2.0 includes the same models available in BMDS 1.4.1, and adds new models including a Hill model, useful for the evaluation of saturable dichotomous responses, and new versions of the familiar quantal models which implement alternative background terms (background additive to dose).</p>

<hr /><p><a name="04" id="04"></a></p>



<h3>October 10, BMDS - News Announcement #4 - Build 19 of BMDS 2.0 beta Release</h3>

<p>BMDS 2.0 Beta – Build 19 released on 10/10/2007 replaces the first BMDS 2.0 Beta release of 9/28/2007 (Build 13). The new Build 19 has important changes and enhancements as a result of additional testing and user exposure and should be downloaded and used instead of Build 13. Enhancements include the ability to better run a number of the BMD models and also added flexibility and fixes for user interface features. Changes include the designation of the new Dichotomous models as Alternate Dichotomous to better reflect their production status. Please refer to the readme.txt file included with the software installation for more details on BMDS 2.0 Beta.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>BMDS 2.0 build 19 is still a beta test version, provided only for your examination and testing - until you receive an announcement that BMDS 2.0 has been finalized BMDS 1.4.1b should be used for definitive risk assessment calculations.</p>

<hr /><p><a name="05" id="05"></a></p>



<h3>November 16, BMDS - News Announcement #5 - Version 1.4.1c Release</h3>

<p>BMDS version 1.4.1c is now available from the BMDS website. This version updates dichotomous models that were already included on BMDS version 1.4.1b. The updates primarily improve the handling of parameter specifications, particularly in situations where the user may wish to specify the background parameter to be zero.</p>

<p>Reminder: EPA is seeking comments over the next two months on BMDS 2.0 Beta (Build 19) released on 10/10/2007 and available from the BMDS website. BMDS 2.0 includes the same models available in BMDS 1.4.1, but adds batch processing features that facilitate running and comparing multiple model and dataset combinations, and includes a new dichotomous Hill model and new versions of the familiar quantal models which implement alternative background terms (background additive to dose).</p>

<h3>July 10, BMDS - News Announcement #6 - BMDS 2.0 has arrived!!</h3>

<p>BMDS 2.0 is now available from the BMDS website. After installing this new version of BMDS, you will find it much easier to perform BMD analyses of multiple endpoints using multiple models. You will be able to prepare reports comparing modeling results in a fraction of the time and in most cases you will be able to easily cut and paste those reports into other (e.g., word processor) applications. BMDS 2.0 uses the same underlying source code for the models in BMDS 1.4.1 software, with minor corrections and some important additions. It contains a new set of quantal models with an alternative background parameter (i.e., background additive to dose) and asymptote parameter (i.e., Hill model for evaluation of saturable dichotomous effects), as well as a suite of beta Exponential models (for increased flexibility in the evaluation of continuous responses). BMDS 2.0 replaces BMDS 1.4.1c as the official and principal supported version of BMDS software. For details on its new features and modeling options, go to the BMDS 2.0 Help menu in the installed software.</p>

<p>Along with the release of BMDS 2.0, EPA has developed a new e-Ticket support system for the reporting of BMDS problems or questions. The e-Ticket form can be accessed through a new Help option within BMDS 2.0, or by going directly to the e-Ticket website.</p>

<h3>October 1, BMDS - News Announcement #7 - New Training Opportunities, BMDS 2.1 beta interface and Time-dependent<br />
	Models Released for Public Comment</h3>

<p>EPA is making BMDS 2.1 Beta available at this time for public review. This version of BMDS uses the same underlying source code for the models already included in BMDS 2.0, with minor corrections and some important additions. The most significant addition is the incorporation of a beta (external peer review) version of a new time-dependent toxicodiffusion model described by Zhu et al. (2005). The BMDS toxicodiffusion model was developed to characterize toxic effects that evolve along critical time points, such as those observed in a neurotoxicity functional observation battery (FOB). BMDS 2.1 Beta also incorporates graphical plots for the continuous exponential models and allows for the use of individual animal continuous response data. Details of the new model and interface enhancements in BMDS 2.1 Beta can be obtained in the Help menu option of the installed software.</p>

<p>In addition, EPA is distributing an external review (beta) version of a concentrationtime (CxT) model originally programmed by Wil ten Berge. The EPA ten Berge model implements an approach to evaluating the CxT relationships for effects associated with chemical exposures. The EPA's version 1.0 implementation of this model is being distributed along with associated documentation and comments on the model received from external peer reviewers. EPA plans to respond to external review comments and incorporate the ten Berge model into a future version of BMDS.</p>

<p>Finally, EPA has updated the website to offer new online and hands-on training opportunities. The online training tutorial has been updated for the 2.x versions of BMDS and a new web page has been added that details upcoming training opportunities.</p>

<h3>July 31, BMDS - News Announcement #9b - Some important notes about BMDS installation</h3>

<p>Those installing BMDS on computers that are login/password secured, you should be aware of the following details:</p>

<ol><li>Make sure that the BMDS software is installed under the USER'S administrative rights so the user will have access to all areas the program needs to access. Note: You will know that the software is installed correctly if it "passes" the test that is initiated when the program first starts and if you are able to save option files from within the batch "session" feature.</li>
	<li>If you do not have a recent version of Windows on your computer, the installation procedure may require you to install the latest version of the .Net software (i.e., 3.5 SP 1) before you install BMDS 2.1. This download and install takes some time (i.e., several minutes), so be patient, but once it is done (you have to reboot), the BMDS installation goes quickly and smoothly. Also, if you have earlier versions of BMDS installed such as BMDS 2.1 beta, you should uninstall it before installing the new BMDS 2.1 version.</li>

<h3>November 2, BMDS - News Announcement #10 - December 5, 2009 SRA Workshop for BMDS 2.1.1 - Preregister by November 6 and Save</h3>

<p>EPA will be conducting the following full day BMDS workshop on December 6 in conjunction with the December 6-9, 2009 Society for Risk Analysis (SRA) conference.</p>

<p class="indented"><strong>Introduction to the Benchmark Dose Methodology and Interactive Application of EPA’s Benchmark Dose Software (BMDS), Version 2.1.1<br />
	SRA 2009 Annual Meeting (Baltimore MD, Dec 5, 2009)</strong></p>

<p class="indented">This daylong course is designed to provide participants with an interactive training workshop on the use of the U.S. EPA’s Benchmark Dose Software, BMDS 2.1.1 and its application to risk assessment. The course will provide instruction in changes that have been implemented in version 2.1.1, including a new user interface that allows multiple run processing, the ability to save model option choices, summary sheets for side-by-side comparison of model results, and enhanced export to spreadsheet functionality. The course will provide an overview of the BMD process, including determination of data adequacy, model fitting, model comparison, selection of a benchmark response level, and modeling linear verses nonlinear responses. Attendees will also work on examples from chemical assessments and learn how to take advantage of the new features offered by version 2.1.1 of BMDS to prepare summary reports for insertion in their assessments. This workshop will cover all the BMD models available in the current version of BMDS—including the recently added dichotomous hill, background dose, and continuous exponential models. This course is an interactive training workshop in the features of BMDS 2.1.1 and it is therefore recommended that prior to this training students who are not familiar with BMD modeling take the online BMD training course in order to ensure that they receive the maximum benefit from participating in the workshop.

<h3>July 28, BMDS - News Announcement #14 - BMDS Training Workshop at the SRA 2011 Annual Meeting</h3>

<p>EPA is announcing an all-day training workshop titled "Benchmark Dose Modeling (BMD) Analysis – an Introduction to BMD Methods and Application of EPA’s Benchmark Dose Software " at the Society for Risk Analysis' 2011 Annual Meeting in Charleston, SC.  </p>

<p>This workshop will provide participants with interactive training on the use of the U.S. EPA’s Benchmark Dose Software (BMDS) and its application to risk assessment. The course will provide an overview of the BMD process, including determination of data adequacy, model fitting and comparison, and selection of a benchmark response level. This workshop will cover all BMD models available in BMDS 2.2 —including the new MS-COMBO model, which calculates multi-tumor composite risk values. Instruction will also be given in regard to new features that have been implemented in version 2.2.  </p>

<p>This interactive training workshop will consist of morning and afternoon sessions. The morning session will include instructor presentations covering the basic science and theory of BMD modeling, and is intended for those with no prior experience in BMD modeling. The afternoon session will expand upon the morning session and will consist of a demonstration of EPA’s BMDS 2.2 through individual and group class modeling exercises. Questions and critical discussions of presentation material and class activities are highly encouraged.  </p>

<p>Registration for the morning and afternoon sessions is independent of one another, participants are encouraged to attend whichever sessions suit their needs, although it is highly recommended that students only attending the afternoon session be reasonably proficient in the science and theory of BMD modeling.  </p>

<p>Participants planning to attend the afternoon session need to bring their own laptops to the workshop with BMDS 2.2 installed (BMDS 2.2 will be available by September 1, 2011). To ensure students receive the maximum benefit from participating in the workshop, it is recommended that they examine the online training and tutorial materials prior to the workshop.</p>

<h3>September 19, BMDS - News Announcement #15 - Release of BMDS 2.2 with MultiTumor Analysis, Dichotomous Data Trend Tests, and improved option file, session, and datafile operability!</h3>

<div>EPA is now distributing Version 2.2 (Build 66) of the Benchmark Dose Software (BMDS). Key enhancements in BMDS 2.2 (Build 66) include:</div>

<ul><li>The ability to perform a combined analysis of multiple independent tumor types by the multistate-cancer model in order to estimate BMDs and BMDLs for the combined incidence of the tumors in question (i.e., BMDs and BMDLs for the likelihood of getting one or more of those tumors).</li>
	<li>The ability to perform a trend test on dichotomous data sets using the Cochran-Armitage trend test described by Haseman (1984). This is the first in a series of trend test to be added to BMDS (future versions will also include trend test for continuous and nested data).</li>
	<li>Modification of the dichotomous Hill model regarding parameter initialization to improve convergence features of this model.</li>
	<li>Variable name changes (e.g., for dose, sample size, response, mean, or standard deviation variables) in one option file in a session can now be automatically transferred to all other option files in that session. Thus, users can change variable name assignments once in a session, without having to make those changes separately in every option file, increasing the utility and efficiency of session batch modeling.</li>
	<li>Newly created dichotomous, continuous or nested model data files will start with default column headers, in a particular order, as appropriate for the type of data (e.g., Dose, N, and Effect for dichotomous datasets; Dose, N, Mean, and Std for summarized continuous datasets). The user may change those default headers, but will be warned that doing so may affect the running of BMDS-supplied sessions that look for those default names.</li>
</ul><div><strong>CHANGES TO BMDS INSTALLATION PROCEDURE </strong></div>

<p>Previous BMDS versions used a SETUP.EXE file to create the BMDS directory, add icons to the Programs menu, provide an entry in the Add/Remove Programs control panel, and so on. However, BMDS 2.2 is being distributed as a compressed ZIP file and does not employ any automated install programs or wizards. The implications of this change are that (a) users do not need administrative rights to install BMDS 2.2, (b) BMDS Version 2.2 can be installed in any folder that the user has create/read/write privileges, and (c) users will need to create their own shortcuts to the program (e.g., on their computer's desktop). </p>

<div><strong>CONSIDERATIONS FOR PREVIOUS BMDS INSTALLATIONS &amp; UNINSTALLING </strong></div>

<p>You do not need to uninstall previous BMDS software before installing BMDS 2.2. However, you may want to do so to avoid any confusion with pre-existing shortcuts or other files.</p>

<div>To uninstall BMDS 2.1.2 or earlier versions:</div>

<ol><li>Go to the Add/Remove Programs control panel (windows XP or earlier) or the Programs and Features control panel (Windows Vista, Windows 7).</li>
	<li>Select the BMDS program in the list.</li>
	<li>Select Uninstall. All data files will remain in place and will not be removed.</li>

<h3>April 3, BMDS - News Announcement #18 - Two Half-Day BMD Training Courses will be offered on May 3, 2012 at TRAC Conference, West Chester, Ohio</h3>

<p>Two half-day BMD training courses will be offered on May 3, 2012 at the Toxicology and Risk Assessment Conference (TRAC) at the Wingate by Wyndham hotel in West Chester Ohio. The morning course will cover "Benchmark Dose Modeling: Theory and Application of Basic Modeling Methodologies in Risk Assessment" and the afternoon course will cover "Benchmark Dose Modeling: Advanced Methodologies and Tools for Performing More Complex Dose-Response Analyses." To register, visit the conference website.</p>

<p>Participants do NOT need to bring laptops to the workshop. Abstracts for the two workshops are shown below.</p>

<div><strong>AM Course (W-5)</strong></div>

<p>Benchmark Dose Modeling: Theory and Application of Basic Modeling Methodologies in Risk Assessment</p>

<p>The objectives of this course are to provide participants with an introduction to the evaluation of dose-response data in accordance with EPA’s Benchmark Dose (BMD) guidelines and how to use the Agency’s Benchmark Dose Software (BMDS) to facilitate BMD analyses in risk assessments. Specific topics covered will include a general overview of the BMD process, determination of data adequacy, model fitting, model comparison, and selection, and choice of a benchmark response level. This course will cover all the BMD models available in the current version of BMDS – including the recently added dichotomous hill and exponential models. In addition, key concepts will also be presented using new features in BMDS version 2.2.</p>

<div>By the end of the course, users will know:</div>

<ul><li>When to apply BMD modeling, how to apply BMD modeling to a dataset, and how to decide which BMD should be selected.</li>
	<li>What a BMD is, and the advantages and disadvantages of using a BMD instead of using LOAEL and/or NOAEL</li>
	<li>How to select a data-set to be modeled, define a benchmark response, and use the BMDS modeling software to calculate a BMD/BMDL</li>
	<li>Understand how BMD values are calculated and various approaches to better approximate equivalent dose in humans using alternative dose metrics </li>
</ul><div><strong>PM Course (W-8)</strong></div>

<p>Benchmark Dose Modeling: Advanced Methodologies and Tools for Performing More Complex Dose-Response Analyses</p>

<p>This half-day course focuses on how to use advanced benchmark dose modeling applications and an overview of Excel-based tools which organize BMD modeling results and other information used in a chemical dose-response assessment. Participants are expected to have a general understanding of benchmark dose modeling, or, have taken the course offered in the AM (W-5), “Benchmark Dose Modeling: Theory and Application of Basic Modeling Methodologies in Risk Assessment”.</p>

<p>This course will provide an overview of modeling continuous and dichotomous datasets using Excel-based software packages called the BMDS Wizard and DRAGON, both of which will be provided to those registered for the course. The BMDS Wizard allows users to build BMDS input from Excel, run BMDS, and import results into an Excel file. In addition to importing all results, it is capable of recommending best-fitting models using customizable decision criteria. It will also demonstrate how to use an additional Excel software package titled the Dose Response Analysis Generator and Organizational Network (DRAGON). The DRAGON is designed to store key dose-response information (BMD, NOAEL, LOAEL, etc.) from multiple studies in one Excel-based database. This course will demonstrate how to use the software, including how to enter information, perform batch BMD modeling for multiple endpoints, calculate standard dosimetric conversions, and generate result reports and documentation.</p>

<div>In addition, this course will demonstrate how to use the following advanced BMD models, and provide fundamental understanding of the approach and modelframework used for the following models: </div>

<ul><li>The MS_Combo model for assessing the risk of developing any number of independent, multiple tumors observed in a single bioassay</li>
	<li>The Multistage Weibull Time-to-Tumor Model (MSW) for cancer analyses when survival rates are observed to differ due to exposure</li>
	<li>The Toxicodiffusion Model for analyzing repeated response data common to many neurotoxicity test guidelines</li>
	<li>Categorical Regression Modeling (CatReg) for modeling data from multiple bioassays or for multiple species simultaneously</li>
</ul><hr /><p><a name="19" id="19"></a></p>

<h3>April 29, BMDS - News Announcement #30 - Release of BMDS 2.4</h3>

<p>EPA is now distributing BMDS 2.4, which adds new topics to the BMDS Help file such as "BMDS Best Practices" and fixes issues related to data entry and running the MS_Combo and ten Berge models. Also, this version of BMDS provides preformatted BMDS Wizard templates. The BMDS Wizard is an Excel-based tool that streamlines data entry and option file creation, and implements logic to compare and analyze modeling results.</p>

<p>TO DOWNLOAD BMDS 2.4 go to the BMDS website.</p>

<p>If you have already installed earlier versions of BMDS, just overwrite those files with the files contained in the BMDS 2.4 zip file.</p>

<hr /><p><a name="31" id="31"></a></p>



<h3>June 17, BMDS - News Announcement #31 - New Installation Instructions for BMDS 2.4</h3>

<p>The instructions on the BMDS website for installation of BMDS 2.4 after it has been downloaded from the website are being revised to read as follows:</p>

<p>In Windows Explorer, double-click the downloaded .zip file. Drag and drop the BMDS240 folder from the .zip file to the C:\USEPA folder of your computer (if you do not have a C:\USEPA folder you will need to create it). BMDS 2.4 needs to be installed in this location to function properly with the new Wizard Excel-based software. Please use the "Problem Report" feature listed in the "Help" menu of BMDS 2.4 or contact us using our Help Desk Form if you experience installation problems or have questions.</p>

<p>NOTE: Previous installation instructions suggested that EPA users could install BMDS 2.4 to their network "My Downloads" directory. Installation in this location currently causes a problem within the plot functionality of BMDS 2.4. We are working to correct this problem, but at this time BMDS 2.4 will only work from a local directory (e.g., the C:\USEPA directory as described above).</p>

<h3>February 14, BMDS - News Announcement #34 - BMDS Wizard 1.8 - New Installation Instructions</h3>

<p>Users have experienced problems running certain BMDS models with the BMDS Wizard that are caused predominantly by having too many or unusual characters in the directory structure where Wizard output files are stored. These problems are generally fixed by renaming the Wizard folder that is currently named "BMDS Wizard 1.8" in the BMDS 2.4 release to something shorter that does not contain the "1.8" text (e.g., "Wizard"). We apologize for any troubles or confusion this may have caused.</p>

<hr /><p><a name="35" id="35"></a></p>



<h3>February 14, BMDS - News Announcement #35 - EPA-specific BMDS Installation Instructions for Windows 7 Upgrade</h3>

<p>For EPA users only, the following installation steps are recommended to optimize the use of BMDS and the BMDS Wizard under the new EPA Windows 7 upgrade.</p>

<ol><li>Download the BMDS 2.4 installation .zip package and unzip it to a local (not network) directory on your computer that contains as <em>few characters as possible, no unusual characters</em> and for which you have <em>read and write authorization</em>. In our experience, the subfolder within C:\Users associated with your EPA user ID works well for this purpose.</li>
	<li>Rename the Wizard folder that is currently named "BMDS Wizard 1.8" in the BMDS 2.4 release to something shorter that does not contain the "1.8" text (e.g., "Wizard").</li>
	<li>For faster processing time, run BMDS and the BMDS Wizard from their local C:\ location and save their output to a local C:\ directory that contains as few characters as possible, no unusual characters and for which you have read and write authorization. (NOTE: Your output files will not be backed up using this approach.)</li>
	<li>To ensure that your output files are saved in a location that is backed up, run the BMDS or Wizard from either a local or network location, but save their output to a "mapped" network directory that contains as <em>few characters as possible, no unusual characters</em> and for which you have <em>read and write authorization</em> (e.g., "Z:\BMDS" or "Z:\Wizard"). (NOTE: This approach will result in slower processing times) <em>CRITICAL NOTE: The Wizard and BMDS will not work properly with a network directory that is not "mapped" to a single letter drive name. Refer to the Readme file that is distributed with BMDS for instructions on how to map a network drive.</em></li>

<h3>May 23, BMDS - News Announcement #36 - Comprehensive Webinar Training on Benchmark Dose Modeling - CLU-In Webinar Series</h3>

<p>Benchmark Dose Modeling - CLU-In Webinar Series</p>

<p>The objective of this webinar series is to provide webinar-based, interactive training on the use of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Benchmark Dose Software (BMDS) and its application to risk assessment. Use of BMD methods addresses many of the limitations of the traditional No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) approach. BMD modeling involves fitting mathematical models to dose-response, and in some cases dose-time-response, data in order to identify points of departure for use in human health risk assessments. This series of webinars will consist of individual training modules focusing on a specific type of data or topic:</p>

<h4 class="highlighted">Session 1 (June 3, 2014: 1:00 PM - 4:30 PM, EDT)</h4>

<ul><li>Introduction - this training module will introduce users to the basic science and theory of BMD modeling and the advantages it holds over the NOAEL approach</li>
	<li>Dichotomous Models - these models describe the dose-response relationship for effects that are measured as incidence</li>
</ul><h4 class="highlighted">Session 2A (June 4, 2014: 9:00 AM - 11:30 AM, EDT)</h4>

<p>Continuous Models - models for describing the dose-response characteristics of effects measured on a continuous scale (e.g., body weight)</p>

<h4 class="highlighted">Session 2B (June 4, 2014: 1:00 PM - 3:30 PM, EDT)</h4>

<p>Nested Dichotomous Models - these models are modified dichotomous models that can describe the inter-litter effects often observed in developmental toxicity studies</p>

<h4 class="highlighted">Session 3A (June 5, 2014: 9:00 AM - 11:30 AM, EDT)</h4>

<p>Cancer Modeling - this module will cover the modeling of cancer data, including modeling individual tumors, modeling multiple tumors within a single bioassay, and modeling tumors when survival rates are observed to differ across exposures</p>

<h4 class="highlighted">Session 3B (June 5, 2014: 1:00 PM - 3:00 PM, EDT)</h4>

<p>Modeling Time - these models can characterize the dose-time-response relationship when animals are exposed for varying durations of time or responses are measured at multiple time points</p>

<p>Each training webinar will be presented as a standalone unit, so users can attend only the webinars of interest of them and still receive a complete and valuable training experience. General topics that will be covered in each webinar include 1) basic BMD modeling workflows, 2) selection of appropriate benchmark response levels, 3) judging model fit, and 4) demonstrations of EPA's BMDS package and the Excel-based BMDS Wizard templates (where appropriate).</p>

<p>Although it is not necessary for participants to attend every webinar, it is highly recommended that all attend the Introduction module, especially if they have no previous BMD experience. If users wish, they can familiarize themselves with basic concepts through the online tutorial and training materials provided on the EPA BMDS website. Participants will need to have version of BMDS 2.5 installed (with necessary administrative rights). Additionally, to use the BMDS Wizard templates, Microsoft Excel must be installed on the user's computers. For participants of the Modeling Time webinar, the R statistical package (preferably version 3.1.0) must also be installed on their computers.</p>

<hr /><p><a name="37" id="37"></a></p>



<h3>May 29, BMDS - News Announcement #37 - BMDS 2.5 with Wizard 1.9 now available for download</h3>

<p>EPA is now distributing BMDS 2.5, with an upgraded version (1.9) of the Excel-based BMDS Wizard. The BMDS Wizard has been upgraded to include a new template that allows users to run the MS_Combo model once all tumors have been run using the cancer template.</p>

<p>Additionally, an issue with the cancer slope factor not exporting correctly has been resolved. A number of fixes have also been made to BMDS: (1) the “View Plot” functionality has been improved to make it easier to generate and edit a plot from a previously created .plt file; (2) the multistage, multistage cancer, and MS_Combo models now provide accurate results when non-integer input data are used and beta parameters are specified by the user; and (3) the power model now honors the direction of adversity specified by the user.</p>

<hr /><p><a name="38" id="38"></a></p>



<h3>June 5, BMDS - News Announcement #38 - Wizard Report Template</h3>

<p>The Wizard Report Template Microsoft Word file (BMDS Wizard Report Template.docx) that is needed for the Wizard report feature that prepares formatted Word tables of model results was inadvertently not shipped with BMDS 2.5. If you have not deleted BMDS 2.4 from your computer, you can copy the report from the ...\BMDS240\Wizard folder and paste it into your ...\BMDS250\Wizard folder. Otherwise, you will be able to obtain the Wizard Report Template file from the BMDS website download page sometime next week.</p>

<hr /><p><a name="39" id="39"></a></p>



<h3>July 2, BMDS - News Announcement #39 - New Version of Polynomial Model Now Available</h3>

<p>EPA is distributing a new version of the BMDS continuous polynomial model that fixes an issue that resulted in incorrect parameter estimates for the first degree (linear) polynomial model when the beta1 (slope) parameter is restricted and variance is modeled as non-constant. Visit the EPA BMDS download page for instructions on how to download and install the new poly.exe model.</p>

<hr /><p><a name="40" id="40"></a></p>



<h3>October 27, BMDS - News Announcement #40 - BMDS Training, SRA 2014 Annual Meeting, Denver, CO (December 11)</h3>

<p>The following BMDS training course will be offered on December 11, 2014 following the 2014 Society for Risk Analysis (SRA) meeting in Denver, CO. Visit the SRA website to register (http://www.sra.org/events/sra-2014-annual-meeting).</p>

<p>The objective of this full-day course is to provide participants with interactive training on the use of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Benchmark Dose Software (BMDS) and its application to risk assessment. Benchmark dose (BMD) modeling involves fitting mathematical models to dose-response data in order to identify points of departure for use in human health risk assessments. BMD modeling addresses many of the limitations of the traditional No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) approach.</p>

<p>In this interactive training workshop, EPA instructors will present: the basic theory of BMD modeling (including selection of a benchmark response level, model fitting and comparison), a demonstration of EPA's BMDS 2.6, and individual and group modeling exercises. Instructors will focus on the use of the Excel-based BMDS Wizard templates that are provided with BMDS 2.6, including the newly developed MS_Combo Wizard template. The BMDS Wizard streamlines BMD analyses by allowing users to build BMDS inputs, run models, and import results in Excel. In addition to importing all results, the BMDS Wizard is capable of recommending best-fitting models using customizable decision criteria.</p>

<p>It is recommended that users familiarize themselves with basic BMD concepts through the online tutorial and training materials provided on the EPA BMDS website. Participants need to bring their own laptops, with BMDS 2.6 installed, to the workshop. To use the BMDS Wizard templates, Microsoft Excel must also be installed on the users' laptops.</p>

<h3>August 6, BMDS-News Announcement #44 - Symantec incorrectly tagged BMDS 00poly.exe file as a virus on August 5, 2015</h3>

<p>On Wednesday, August 5, 2015, EPA became aware that the Symantec virus protection database had incorrectly identified the 00poly.exe file of BMDS as a virus. As a result, BMDS users that receive virus protection from Symantec may have had this file deleted from their computer. EPA has since informed Symantec of this error and Symantec has verified the mistaken identification and removed the 00poly.exe file from their list of viruses. </p>

<p><strong>For BMDS users that have had their 00poly.exe file removed by their Symantec software</strong>, EPA is making available in the near future a "patch" containing a recompiled 00poly.exe file on the <a href="../node/83971.html">BMDS download page</a>. Users can download the patch to reinsert the 00poly.exe file into the BMDS folder on their computer.</p>

<p>BMDS users that have not had their 00poly.exe file removed do not need to take any action, and future downloads of the BMDS software should not trigger a Symantec alert.</p>

<p>We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. Please contact us if you have any further questions or concerns.</p>

<h3>August 25, BMDS - News Announcement #45 - December 6, 2015 Training Course in use of EPA Categorical Regression Software (CatReg)</h3>

<p>The U.S. EPA will provide a full-day training course on the use of the EPA's Categorical Regression software (CatReg) and its application to risk assessment on December 6, 2015 at the 2015 Society for Risk Analysis (SRA) Annual meeting.  To sign up for the course, visit the SRA website at  <a href="http://www.sra.org/events/sra-2015-annual-meeting">http://www.sra.org/events/sra-2015-annual-meeting</a>.</p>

<p>Categorical regression modeling involves fitting mathematical models to toxicity data that has been assigned ordinal severity categories (i.e., minimal, mild, or marked effects) and can be associated with up to two explanatory variables corresponding to exposure conditions, usually concentration and duration.  CatReg calculates the probabilities of observing the different severity categories over the continuum of the explanatory variables describing exposure conditions.  The categorization of observed responses allows the expression of dichotomous, continuous, and descriptive data in terms of response severity and supports the analysis of data from single studies or multiple studies.  CatReg can also estimate the lower confidence limit on the dose (the equivalent of a BMDL) associated with a given severity probability and exposure duration.</p>

<p>Additionally, the meta-analytical capability of CatReg allows for the filtering of data in order to determine statistically significant different responses between sexes, strains, and/or species.  Recently, EPA has released a new graphic-user interface for CatReg that will greatly increase the efficiency with which users can perform categorical regression analyses; this version of the software will be the focus of this training workshop.</p>

<h3>November 10, BMDS - News Announcement #47: Register now for EPA Model Averaging Workshop (December 10-11, 2015)</h3>

<h3 class="highlighted">EPA's National Center for Environmental Assessment (NCEA) is hosting a public workshop on model averaging methods for dose-response analysis. The workshop will be held via webinar in two half-day increments (12:00 PM to 4:00 PM EST) on December 10-11, 2015. Meeting registration is now available. Details are provided at <a href="../node/124759.html">http://www2.epa.gov/bmds/model-averaging-webinar-workshop-announcement</a>.</h3>

<p>The purpose of this workshop is to obtain expert peer consultation on model averaging methods for dose-response analysis. To facilitate the workshop, EPA will provide invited workshop consultants with background and support materials for consideration, including a document describing methods that are consistent with published recommendations and software that illustrates how those existing methods could be implemented. Workshop consultants will examine EPA's background and support material and provide written comments prior to the workshop. Discussions and conclusions reached during the workshop will form the basis of a workshop report that EPA will consider for the identification of the model averaging method(s) that offer(s) the greatest potential for the development of chemical health assessments. While the workshop support material and software describe candidate methods for use in evaluating continuous response measures, participants will also be asked to comment on the potential for extension of any preferred method(s) identified to dichotomous response measures.</p>

<p><em><strong>Dates:</strong></em> The workshop is scheduled for <strong>December 10 - 11, 2015</strong>. The workshop will consist of two half-day webinar workshop sessions (12:00 PM to 4:00 PM EST) on Model Averaging Methods. The agenda and workshop support material will be posted to the <a href="../node/124759.html">workshop webpage</a>.</p>

<p><em><strong>Location:</strong></em>This workshop will be held only by webinar. The workshop will be open to attendance by interested public attendees on a first-come, first-served basis up to the limits of available webinar room.</p>

<p><em><strong>Public Participation: </strong></em>Instructions for workshop registration are described below. Interested parties with expertise in this field of study are invited to provide their perspective by preparing a brief presentation (≤ 5 minutes) for the workshop consultants. Instructions for requesting to make a presentation at the workshop are provided below.</p>

<p><em><strong>Background: </strong></em>The benchmark dose (BMD) method is a key component of chemical risk assessments performed by EPA, other U.S Federal and State Agencies, and multiple international organizations. The BMD method is used to establish toxicity values such as EPA reference doses and cancer slope factors for chemicals expected to have human health effects. Existing BMD methods involve the selection of a single dose-response model from among a suite of models with little biological basis, based largely on a comparison of model fits to the data. As such, they have been criticized for not adequately accounting for model uncertainty and biological considerations. Model averaging is a well-recognized and published scientific approach that can assist in the characterization of model uncertainty, and has the potential for incorporating biological considerations. Bayesian methods can be applied to allow prior information, including biological considerations, to influence model averaging results. Given these potential benefits, model averaging and several model averaging approaches are being investigated and tested by EPA.</p>

<p><strong>Registration</strong></p>

<p>This workshop will be held only via webinar. The workshop will be open to attendance by interested public attendees on a first-come, first-served basis up to the limits of the webinar room. Registration to attend by webinar will remain open until the conclusion of the workshop.</p>

<p>To register for the workshop, please send your name, title, affiliation, contact information, and if you are interested in making a brief presentation to <a href="mailto:EPA_MA_Workshop@icfi.com">EPA_MA_Workshop@icfi.com</a>.
