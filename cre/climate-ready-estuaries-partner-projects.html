<h3>Buzzard Bay National Estuary Program</h3>

<h4>Environmental Justice Project on Sea Level Rise Impacts: 2012</h4>

<p>The Buzzards Bay National Estuary Program and Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management have jointly conducted a preliminary evaluation of sea level rise impacts to New Bedford Harbor. A hurricane barrier and dikes protect an environmental justice community, a heavily urbanized and industrial area, and a nationally important fishing fleet and seafood processing industry. Sea level rise with expected higher annual rainfalls and more intense storms, will appreciably impact the wastewater treatment, CSO system, and municipal stormwater networks of each harbor community. BBNEP has found that the hurricane barrier could have widespread failures from the 100-year storm event in conjunction with sea level rise. BBNEP, in partnership with MA CZM and the affected communities will evaluate these issues in detail and develop a long-term strategy for climate change adaptation. BBNEP will also collaborate with local partners to conduct a climate change adaptation workshop and incorporate the results of the evaluation study into training workshops for officials of the harbor communities.</p>

</ul><h3>Casco Bay Estuary Partnership</h3>

<h4 class="highlighted">Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment: 2015</h4>

<p>The objective is to create a broad, risk-based climate change vulnerability assessment and action plan for the Casco Bay Plan.</p>

<h4>Examining Strategies for Investing in Ecosystem Services in Casco Bay Tidal Wetlands: 2015</h4>

<p>Tools from planning, economics, and ecology are available to bring some order to decision making under the combination of heightened uncertainty and secular change imposed on coastal ecosystems by climate change and other stressors. This project will focus on how climate change, sea level rise, and uncertainty  influence relative value of different strategies for investment in ecosystem services in Casco Bay tidal wetlands.</p>

<h4>Climate Change in the Casco Bay Watershed: Past, Present and Future: 2009</h4>

<p>Casco Bay Estuary Partnership developed a climate change stakeholder outreach plan that targets local decision makers and integrates consideration of ecosystem resilience into broader messages about climate change. These outreach and stakeholder engagement efforts will help inform the development of a climate change adaptation plan for the estuary.</p>

</ul><h3>Casco Bay Estuary Partnership and Piscataqua Region Estuaries Partnership</h3>

<h4>Sea Level Rise and Storm Surge Adaptation Analysis via COAST: 2011</h4>

<p>The Casco Bay Estuary Partnership and the Piscataqua Region Estuaries Partnership are working in partnership with the New England Environmental Finance Center to evaluate the vulnerability of communities in their watersheds to sea level rise and storm surge through the COAST model (COastal Adaptation to Sea level rise Tool).</p>

</ul><h3>Massachusetts Bay Program</h3>

<h4>Blue Carbon, Green Eelgrass: 2015</h4>

<p>This project will expand regional planning regarding blue carbon to include eelgrass restoration and protection. It will document eelgrass carbon sequestration, use sea level rise predictions to estimate eelgrass meadow changes, and inform local and state-level decisionmaking about blue carbon and eelgrass.</p>

<h4>Vulnerability Assessment for the Coastal Zone: 2008</h4>

<p>The Massachusetts Bays Program worked in partnership with EPA's Office of Research and Development to use expert elicitation as a methodology for identifying climate change-related risks.  In this pilot study, groups of experts focused on key ecosystem processes related to sediment retention in mudflats and salt marshes and resulting impacts on nesting habitat for salt marsh sparrows.  Results from this effort were published in February 2012 in the report, <em>Vulnerability Assessments in Support of the Climate Ready Estuaries Program: A Novel Approach Using Expert Judgment, Volume II: Results for the Massachusetts Bays Program</em>.</p>

</ul><h3>Narragansett Bay Estuary Program</h3>

<h4>Assessment of Climate Change Adaptation Measures for the Lower Pawtuxet River, Rhode Island: 2011</h4>

<p>The Narragansett Bay Estuary Program will analyze dams and other in-stream structures in the Pawtuxet River watershed for their vulnerability to climate change and flooding, and impacts on watershed restoration efforts.</p>

<ul><li><a href="http://www.neiwpcc.org/nbep.asp">For more information, visit Narragansett Bay Estuary Program</a>.</li>
</ul><h3>Piscataqua Region Estuaries Partnership</h3>

<h4>The Oyster Culvert Analysis Project: 2008</h4>

<p>The Piscataqua Region Estuaries Partnership launched a study to identify road culverts that are susceptible to failure in the face of increasingly severe storms and from hydrological modifications related to development in the watershed. PREP completed this study in March 2010 and published a report.</p>

<h3>Barnegat Bay Partnership</h3>

<h4 class="highlighted">Conducting a broad, risk-based vulnerability assessment and integrating climate change considerations into the BBP’s revised CCMP: 2016</h4>

<p>A broad, risk-based climate change vulnerability assessment will be conducted to determine the risks from relevant climate stressors on the program’s current/revised Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan goals. A variety of outreach materials will also be developed to aid in the bay’s protection.</p>

<h4>Sea Level Rise and Barnegat Bay’s Wetlands: A Look at Potential Impacts: 2015</h4>

<p>This project will examine Barnegat Bay shorelines to identify potential areas of marsh migration and possible impacts to existing developed areas due to tidal inundation from sea level rise. Maps will display places where roads and other structures cross tidal wetlands, and identify areas as either being at risk of conflict between rising seas and existing development or as areas that can accommodate potential tidal wetland migration.</p>

<h4>Support of Climate Change Workgroup Activities: Climate Change Technical Workshop: 2009</h4>

<p>Barnegat Bay Partnership worked with the Jacques Cousteau National Estuarine Research Reserve to continue its climate change vulnerability assessment and adaptation planning efforts by forming a climate change workgroup and holding a series of listening sessions to gain stakeholder support and identify opportunities for improving resilience through adaptation actions. NOAA's Coastal Services Magazine published an article in March/April 2010 describing their efforts.</p>
