	The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has reaffirmed its initial determination that there are adequate facilities around Lake Erie for boats to pump out their sewage. The determination will allow the establishment of a “no discharge zone” for 593 square miles of the lake, its tributaries and bays, and 84 miles of shoreline that comprise the New York State portion of the lake. The EPA is providing an opportunity for the public to comment on the boat sewage dumping ban for a second time. The EPA initially made a determination in December 2012 that adequate sewage pump out facilities exist and that the state’s proposal to designate areas of Lake Erie as a “no discharge zone” can go forward. The EPA received significant comments questioning the availability of sewage pump-out facilities, particularly for larger vessels, and the EPA conferred with New York State to gather more information. That information gathering is now complete and the EPA is confirming its original opinion that there are adequate facilities.</p>

	On September 25, 2013, the EPA opened dockets on a number of soil, structural, commodity, and antimicrobial fumigants for a 60-day comment period, making preliminary work plans for each fumigant included in the group and supporting documents that outline anticipated risk assessment and data needs available. These documents will assist the public in understanding the types of information and issues that may be considered during the course of registration review, which is the EPA’s periodic reevaluation of all registered pesticides to ensure that products in the marketplace can still be used safely. The agency is seeking comments on these documents and requesting information on the use parameters, or where and how these fumigants should be used. The comment period closes on November 25, 2013. The agency is using this process to continue the dialogue with stakeholders on label issues that have emerged during the reregistration label implementation process for the soil fumigants and throughout registration review.</p>

	In June, the President reaffirmed his commitment to reducing carbon pollution when he directed many federal agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency, to take meaningful steps to mitigate the current and future damage caused by carbon dioxide emissions and to prepare for the anticipated climate changes that have already been set in motion. <br />
	Climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time. Based on the evidence, more than 97% of climate scientists are convinced that human caused climate change is occurring. If our changing climate goes unchecked, it will have devastating impacts on the United States and the planet. Reducing carbon pollution is critically important to the protection of Americans’ health and the environment upon which our economy depends.</p>

<p><strong>EPA Proposes Registration of Nanosilver Pesticide Product</strong><br />
	On August 27, 2013, the EPA announced a proposed decision to register a nanosilver-containing antimicrobial pesticide product named "Nanosilva." This silver-based product is used as a non-food-contact preservative to protect plastics and textiles (e.g., in household items, electronics, sports gear, hospital equipment, bathroom fixtures and accessories) from odor and stain causing bacteria, fungi, mold and mildew. The EPA evaluated the exposure to nanosilver from Nanosilva using data showing that plastics and textiles treated with the product released, at most, exceedingly small amounts of silver. The EPA reviewed other information on the product submitted by the applicant. We also used data from the scientific literature to evaluate the hazard of nanosilver. Based on this evaluation, the agency determined that Nanosilva will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on people, including children, or the environment. As a condition of registration, the EPA is requiring the company to generate additional data, for example, to confirm the agency's understanding of the size of nanosilver particles in the product.</p>

<p><strong>Pesticide News Story: EPA Announces New Guidance and Policies for an Integrated Approach to Pesticide Testing and Assessment</strong><br />
	Strategic Direction for New Pesticide Testing and Assessment Approaches." The EPA is developing and evaluating new technologies in molecular, cellular and computational sciences to supplement or replace more traditional methods of toxicity testing and risk assessment. This document creates a framework for hypothesis-based, systematic integration of exposure and hazard information to assess pesticide risk. OPP's strategic direction is consistent with the 2007 and 2009 National Research Council reports, "Toxicity Testing in the 21st Century: A Vision and a Strategy" and "Science and Decisions: Advancing Risk Assessment." These actions are significant milestones toward the agency's longer term vision for a paradigm shift to 21st Century science.</p>

<p><strong>Pesticide News Story: EPA Makes Emergency Exempted and Special Local Needs Pesticide Products Available in Indian Country Nationwide</strong><br />
	On Tuesday, May 21, 2013, Acting Administrator Bob Perciasepe finalized a program to allow growers in Indian country nationwide to use certain registered pesticide products not currently available for use in Indian country to combat pests in emergency situations or when there is a special local need. Under federal pesticide law, tribes and farmers in Indian country do not explicitly have access to the benefits of pesticide emergency exemptions or special local needs registrations (state-specific registrations). Pest control products permitted under these circumstances may be especially useful when growers in a particular region identify a pest problem that federally registered products do not currently alleviate. Lack of availability of these products denies access for growers and public health officials in Indian country to the same pest control tools that are available elsewhere in the United States.</p>

	As hurricane season approaches, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is issuing a Hazardous Weather Release Prevention and Reporting alert to remind facility operators of certain regulations that require minimization of chemical releases during process shutdown operations. This alert is designed to increase awareness among facility operators about their obligation to operate facilities safely and report chemical releases in a timely manner. <br />
	The alert specifies operational release minimization requirements and clarifies reporting requirements, including exemptions. Unlike some natural disasters, the onset of a hurricane is predictable and allows for early preparations to lessen its effect on a facility. Before hurricane force winds and associated storm surge flooding damage industrial processes, the alert recommends that operators take preventive action by safely shutting down processes, or otherwise operate safely under emergency procedures.<span> </span></p>

<p><strong>Pesticide News Story: USA Today: EPA ensures safety </strong><br />
	Your article "Study: Two-thirds of pesticides got flawed EPA approval" about EPA's process for ensuring the safety of chemicals in consumer products, mischaracterizes federal law and the agency's work to protect people's health and the environment.<br />
	Consistent with federal pesticide laws, a pesticide never enters the marketplace without testing to ensure safety for both human health and the environment.<br />
	The Environmental Protection Agency allows expanded uses of already-registered pesticides (known as conditional registration) only if there are sufficient data to ensure that human health and the environment are protected. Based on EPA's in-depth analysis in 2012, over 90% of conditionally registered products involve pesticides that are identical to pesticides already in the marketplace, or differed only in ways that EPA scientists believed would not significantly increase any negative effects.</p>

<p><strong>Pesticide News Story: Buffer Zone Calculator is Available to Assist Soil Fumigant Applicators</strong><br />
	An electronic Buffer Zone Calculator is available in EPA's Soil Fumigant Toolbox. The EPA developed this new tool to help soil fumigant applicators, growers, enforcement personnel and others determine the buffer zone distances now required by soil fumigant product labels. Buffer zones provide distance between the edge of fields treated with pesticides and bystanders, people who live, work or otherwise spend time nearby.<br />
	When the final set of soil fumigant label changes went into effect on December 1, 2012, implementing important new protections for workers and bystanders, buffer zones were among the mitigation measures that began appearing on fumigant labels. As of that date, only soil fumigant products bearing all of the required risk mitigation measures may be sold and distributed by registrants. Growers and applicators can still apply products bearing old labels until supplies are exhausted. However, labels of newly purchased products require applicators to calculate and observe buffer zones when applying soil fumigants.</p>

	This issue of <em>Nonpoint Source News-Notes </em>focuses on states' use of Clean Water State Revolving Funds (CWSRF) to support nonpoint source pollution management projects. The CWSRF was established in 1987 to fund the construction of publicly owned treatment works (POTWs), non­point source pollution management and estuary protection projects. Historically, the majority of CWSRF funding has been directed toward POTWs, with 4.2 percent of cumulative funding provided to nonpoint source projects. Even at 4.2 percent, given that total cumulative CWSRF funding to date is currently $95.4 billion, the amount loaned for nonpoint source projects over the years is about $4 billion. Importantly, more states are discovering creative ways to leverage CWSRF to support both POTWs and nonpoint source projects.</p>
