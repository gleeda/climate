	EPA is making available for comment a White Paper describing how the Agency is proposing to modify its current approach to plant-incorporated protectants (PIPs) in breeding line intermediates (BLIs) under Section 3, Registration of Pesticides, of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). A PIP is a type of pesticide intended to be produced and used in a living plant, or the produce thereof. A BLI is an intermediate used in plant breeding to bring together, or “stack,” two or more PIPs that have each been individually engineered into different lines of a seed propagated plant. These proposed changes are intended to bring efficiencies to the Agency's approach to PIPs in BLIs while not reducing EPA's ability to ensure that PIPs in BLIs meet the requirements of FIFRA.</p>

	The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is establishing the final Phosphorus Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) for the twelve Vermont segments of Lake Champlain. Too much phosphorus pollution is reaching Lake Champlain primarily from the streams and rivers draining into it. The primary concern is polluted runoff – rainwater or snowmelt that drains off of parking lots, roads and streets, logging roads, farm fields and croplands, and lawns. The runoff carries pollutants – sediment, nutrients such as phosphorus that are naturally present in soils, pet and animal wastes, fertilizers, and other pollutants – and deposits these pollutants into streams and rivers or directly into Lake Champlain. Long-term trends since 1990 indicate that phosphorus concentrations in several segments continue to increase.</p>

<p>As part of its ongoing work to address the illegal use of toxic pesticides containing methyl bromide in the Caribbean, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has issued legal complaints against two individuals and a pest control company in Puerto Rico for violating federal pesticides law (the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, or FIFRA) and the Clean Air Act. From 2013 to early 2015, Edwin Andujar Bermudez, doing business as Truly Nolen Pest Control De Caguas, and Wilson J. Torres Rivera, the owner of Tower &amp; Son Exterminating, Corp., fumigated residences and other unauthorized locations in several Puerto Rico municipalities with pesticides containing methyl bromide. The use of methyl bromide is restricted in the U.S. due to its acute toxicity and because it is an ozone-depleting substance. As certified applicators, Mr. Andujar and Mr. Torres face civil penalties under FIFRA, as does Mr. Torres’ company. Mr. Andujar and Tower &amp; Son Exterminating, Corp. additionally face civil penalties under the Clean Air Act.</p>
