<p><strong>EPA Issuing Interim Guidance Concerning Antimicrobial Data Requirements</strong><br />
	Today, EPA is issuing interim guidance that clarifies EPA’s toxicology data requirements for antimicrobial pesticides used on food contact surfaces. In general, if pesticide residues in food resulting from use on food contact surfaces are 200 parts per billion (ppb) or less, EPA requires certain toxicology data. If residues are greater than 200 ppb, additional data may be required, depending on other conditions such as test results. The interim guidance clarifies that the 200 ppb trigger is based on total estimated daily dietary intake for an individual and not on the amount of residue present on a single food. This interpretation is consistent with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) policy.</p>

	Today EPA is extending for 30 days the comment period on a proposed framework intended to delay the corn rootworm from becoming resistant to Bt pesticides produced by genetically engineered corn. This extension is in response to several stakeholders’ requests for additional time to develop comments. By extending the comment period EPA hopes to ensure that all stakeholders have ample opportunity to participate.<br />
	The proposed framework includes requirements on the manufacturers of Bt corn including:</p>

<ul type="disc"><li>In areas at risk of corn rootworm resistance, require crop rotation, use of corn varieties containing more than one Bt toxin, or other Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies and stewardship for corn rootworm.</li>
	<li>Develop and implement a strategy to better detect and address areas of resistance as they emerge.</li>
	<li>Use different and improved scientific tests and sampling requirements to study the problem and more reliably ensure that resistance to the Bt corn toxin is identified. </li>

<p><strong>Data Sharing Memorandum of Understanding between EPA and FDA</strong><br />
	EPA and the Food and Drug Administration are pleased to announce a Memorandum of Understanding to share data on pesticides and toxic substances. This sharing of information will better inform both agencies’ assessments of the risks to the public and the environment. FDA and EPA have complementary roles in their regulatory authority for some substances incorporated into food (including animal food and feed), animal drugs, and cosmetics. FDA is responsible for protecting and promoting the public health by ensuring, among other things, the safety of food (including animal food and feed), animal drugs, and cosmetics by enforcing the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and several related public health laws. EPA is responsible for managing the pesticides and toxic substances programs under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, the FD&amp;C Act, and the Toxic Substances Control Act. The MOU establishes a process of disclosure and sharing of their respective databases that will facilitate the decisions of each agency related to food safety, veterinary medications, and cosmetics. This data sharing will provide the most up-to-date information and assist in coordinating reviews between agencies.</p>

Recognizing beekeepers’ need for additional registered tools to combat the Varroa mite in U.S. honey bee colonies, the EPA collaborated with the U.S. Department of Agriculture on the registration. <br />
	Consistent with <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/06/20/presidential-memorandum-creating-federal-strategy-promote-health-honey-b" target="_blank">President Obama’s 2014 initiative on pollinator health</a>, which instructed the EPA to expedite review of registration applications for new products targeting pests harmful to pollinators, OPP expedited the review of the application. EPA was able to expedite its evaluation in part due to a NAFTA “work share” agreement, which allowed Health Canada’s Pest Management Regulatory Agency to share their data reviews with EPA risk assessors and risk managers. Oxalic acid was registered in Canada for in-hive control of Varroa mites in 2010. EPA also had an established database of oxalic acid studies from its previous registration as an antimicrobial pesticide.</p>

<p><strong>EPA Reaches Settlement on Legal Challenge to Updated Data Requirements for Registration of Antimicrobial Pesticides</strong><br />
	EPA and the American Chemistry Council have reached a settlement agreement that addresses ACC’s petition for judicial review of EPA’s updated 40 CFR Part 158W data requirements for antimicrobial pesticides. Among the provisions of the settlement agreement, EPA will issue a proposed guidance document, “Antimicrobial Pesticide Use Site Index,” for public comment on the schedule included in the settlement agreement. The site index will include a compilation of existing antimicrobial pesticide use sites and identify how each use site fits within the 12 use patterns established in the regulation. This guidance document will help prospective registrants by making it easier for them to identify which data are necessary to register their product(s).</p>

<p><strong>EPA Registers New Insecticide Alternative to Neonicotinoids, Safer for Bees</strong><br />
	The EPA is registering a new insecticide, flupyradifurone, that is safer for bees. It is expected to be an alternative to more toxic products including certain pyrethroid, neonicotinoid, organophosphate and avermectin insecticides. As an insecticide, flupyradifurone is unusual in that laboratory-based studies indicate that the compound is practically non-toxic to adult honeybees. Studies show no adverse effect on overall bee colony performance or overwintering ability when compared to untreated colonies. EPA’s decision meets the rigorous Food Quality Protection Act standard of "reasonable certainty of no harm" to human health. On the basis of protective and conservative human health and ecological risk assessments for the uses of the pesticide, EPA confirmed the safety of the use for the public, agricultural workers and wildlife. EPA coordinated its evaluation with our counterparts in Canada and Australia.</p>

<p><strong>EPA Revised Chlorpyrifos Assessment Shows Risk to Workers</strong><br />
	Today, EPA is releasing an assessment for public comment on the potential for human health risk of the pesticide chlorpyrifos. This assessment shows some risks to workers who mix, load and apply chlorpyrifos pesticide products. When used in large amounts, chlorpyrifos has the potential to pose risks in limited geographic areas when drinking water from small watersheds. There were no additional risks from pesticide exposures in food or exposures to bystanders and workers from airborne chlorpyrifos. The latest USDA pesticide residue data show no concerns for chlorpyrifos in food, with the pesticide detected in less than 1% of samples.</p>

<p><strong>EPA Awards PREP Grant to Washington State University</strong><br />
	EPA’s Office of Pesticide Programs, in partnership with the Office of Compliance, has awarded Washington State University in Pullman, WA the Pesticide Regulatory Education Program (PREP) grant. Through the grant, EPA expects to provide up to $535,000 annually for up to five years (fiscal years 2015 through 2019), subject to funding availability, satisfactory performance and other applicable considerations. The goal of the PREP program is to provide educational training to develop or enhance the abilities of states, tribes and territories to implement pesticide regulatory and enforcement programs or undertake new initiatives. The training includes pesticide program issues (e.g., water quality, pesticide product registration, applicator certification and training, worker safety), compliance and enforcement, and other support topics (e.g., risk communication, managerial and leadership training). The PREP training is intended for senior-level management with pesticide regulatory programs in states, tribes and U.S. territories working under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act Cooperative Agreement with EPA. PREP builds networks and collaborative working relationships among states, tribes, territories and EPA and other federal agencies to more effectively utilize limited resources.</p>
