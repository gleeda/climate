	EPA is now accepting nominations for the 2015 Environmental Merit Awards, which will recognize environmental achievements during the past year. Award categories are available for individuals, businesses, governmental entities, and other organizations. Awards are also given under a lifetime achievement category. These regional awards have been given out annually since EPA was created in 1970. Past recipients have included scientists, community activists, business representatives, public officials and other individuals committed to preserving the environment. An independent EPA panel will select the winners based on the following criteria: long-term effects on the environment; ability to address an environmental problem or need; collaboration with others; ability of the program or accomplishments to be widely shared; clarity and effectiveness of the presentation; and promotion of innovative ideas or techniques. Awards are traditionally given in four categories: individual; business, industry, trade, and professional organization; local, state or federal government; and environmental, community or non-profit organization.</p>

<p><strong>Pesticide News Story: Upgrades to Endangered Species Web Tool: Bulletins Live! Two</strong><br />
	EPA is releasing Bulletins Live! Two, an upgraded version of Bulletins Live!, a web-based map application used to access geographically-specific threatened and endangered species protection Bulletins. This system is an important tool for pesticide users since it makes it easier to find pesticide use limitations for specific areas. Go to www.epa.gov/oppfead1/endanger/bulletins.htm to view the new application. Please note, if you are using Internet Explorer and have accessed Bulletins Live! in the past, you will need to clear your history or set your browser to check for newer versions of stored pages. Bulletins generated by the application contain enforceable, geographically-specific pesticide use limitations that are necessary to ensure using a pesticide will not harm a threatened or endangered species or their critical habitat designated under the Endangered Species Act. A reference to Bulletins on a pesticide label ensures that the Bulletin’s pesticide use limitations are enforceable under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act.</p>

<p><strong>Pesticide News Story: Announcing the SmartLabel Pilot Program</strong><br />
	In an effort to make pesticide label information easier to find and the approval of pesticide labels more efficient, EPA is working with pesticide registrants to pilot an electronic label system. As part of the SmartLabel pilot, nine pesticide registrants will be developing and submitting pesticide labels to EPA through a fully electronic system instead of as paper or PDF files. One of the goals of the SmartLabel system is to make label information more quickly available to the public in an easily searchable format. As a fully electronic system, SmartLabel will make the label approval process more efficient by creating standardized label sections for all pesticide labels. The system will also make it easier to compare previous label versions without losing the necessary flexibility to make a label appropriate for each product.</p>

<p><strong>Pesticide News Story: Expanding Opportunities for Minor Crops - Proposed Rule to Revise Crop Grouping</strong><br />
	EPA is making available for public comment a proposed rule to revise the pesticide crop grouping regulations that allow the establishment of tolerances (maximum residue levels) for groups of related crops. The proposed revisions will expand the number of crops that can have tolerances established and thus will allow minor-use growers a wider choice of pest control tools, including lower-risk pesticides, to be used on minor crops, both domestically and in countries that export food to the United States. Crop groupings allow petitioners to request tolerances for multiple related commodities based on research data on a representative crop. This is the fourth in a series of revisions to the crop groupings. The proposed revisions, published in a <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=EPA-HQ-OPP-2006-0766-0054">November 14, 2014, Federal Register Notice</a>, would revise the existing leafy vegetable and brassica vegetable crop groups, as well as establish new crop groups, including: stalk, stem and leaf petioles; tropical fruit, inedible peel; and tropical fruit, edible peel.</p>

	In 2009, EPA considered two petitions from the Natural Resources Defense Council to cancel the use of propoxur and tetrachlorvinphos (TCVP) in pet products. In response, EPA developed new human health risk assessments for the pet uses of both pesticides. In 2013, EPA found unacceptable risks to children from exposure to propoxur pet collars. EPA and the manufacturers reached an agreement to cancel propoxur pet collar products.

<p><strong>Reorganization of OPP’s Registration Division - Improves workflow, Increases Efficiency</strong><br />
	In order to better meet commitments under the Pesticide Registration Improvement Act (PRIA III), the Registration Division in EPA’s Office of Pesticide Programs has undergone a staff reorganization effective October 18, 2014. The reorganization created two additional risk management branches and so will allow for a greater number of staff to work more directly on registration actions. The Registration Division is responsible for conventional chemical risk management for new chemical registrations, new product registrations, registration amendments and new use reviews, tolerances, experimental use permits, and emergency exemptions for conventional chemical pesticides.</p>

<p><strong>Pesticide News Story: EPA Updates Dietary Exposure Analysis Model</strong><br />
	EPA has updated the Dietary Exposure Evaluation Model-Food Commodity Intake Database (DEEM-FCID)/Calendex to include more recent food consumption data. New online applications will also make it easier for the public to access and interpret the data. DEEM-FCID/Calendex is a dietary exposure analysis model for performing chronic and acute exposure assessments. DEEM-FCID/Calendex can be used to estimate dietary intake of toxicants, nutrients, pesticides, food additives and natural constituents – in other words, for any component of food or water. The software also allows for estimation of exposures for each eating occasion rather than considering the entire day’s food and drink intake at once. This allows EPA to make more refined risk assessments where appropriate.</p>

<p><strong>EPA is Advancing Pollinator Science and Sharing Useful Information with Growers and Beekeepers</strong><br />
	On June 20, 2014, President Obama issued a directive to federal agencies to create a federal strategy to promote honey bee and other pollinator health. The President’s directive created a Pollinator Health Task Force, co-chaired by EPA and USDA, and charged federal agencies with expanding federal efforts and taking new steps to reverse pollinator losses. Scientists believe that honey bee losses are likely caused by multiple stressors, including poor bee nutrition, loss of forage lands, parasites, pathogens, and pesticides. EPA will address the role of pesticides and take action, as appropriate, to protect pollinators.</p>

<p><strong>Central Data Exchange Registration Walkthrough for EDSP Test Order Recipients (Pesticides) – Tuesday, February 25, 2014 </strong><br />
	EPA is developing a fully electronic, Web-based submission system to handle the receipt of responses to future Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP) test orders. Recipients of these orders will be required to register with and submit through the Central Data Exchange (CDX) to use this system.<br />
	On Tuesday, February 25, 2014, from 1:00 – 4:00 p.m. ET, EPA will be conducting, for pesticide stakeholders, a Web-based walk through of the registration process in preparation for these orders.  Please note that the focus of the session is on the registration process, and that specific reporting requirements will not be discussed during the demonstration.</p>

<p><strong>EPA Seeks Public Comment on Draft Guidance Documents for Evaluating Pesticide Spray Drift: Proposals Would Further Protect Communities near Fields Where Crops Are Grown</strong><br />
	EPA is announcing the availability of two draft guidance documents for public comment. These documents describe how off-site spray drift will be evaluated for ecological and human health risk assessments for pesticides. EPA is seeking to strengthen its protections for people and the environment from exposure to pesticides that drift from fields to nearby areas, including homes, schools and playgrounds. The Agency has a long-standing history of robust, routine assessments on every chemical to protect consumers from pesticide risks from treated food, workers who apply pesticides, and consumers who use pesticides in and around homes. These new approaches add to these routine assessments and will allow the Agency to estimate off-site drift, another step to protect communities living near fields where crops are grown from these exposures. The January 29, 2014, Federal Register Notice specifically seeks public input on these approaches that include:</p>

<ul><li>a policy for conducting human health risk assessments associated with the potential for exposure from off-site drift during pesticide applications and</li>
	<li>an updated method for estimating environmental exposures associated with spray drift.</li>
</ul><p><strong><a href="http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/596e17d7cac720848525781f0043629e/8bc5432a63afa2e885257c70005e05b6!OpenDocument">EPA Releases Climate Assessment Update To National Stormwater Calculator</a></strong><br />
	Today, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released phase II of the National Stormwater Calculator and Climate Assessment Tool package. The updated calculator includes future climate vulnerability scenarios.</p>

<p><strong>Pesticide News Story: RNAi White Paper Published in Advance of January 28 Scientific Advisory Panel Meeting</strong><br />
	The EPA has posted a paper, "RNAi Technology as a Pesticide: Problem Formulation for Human Health and Ecological Risk Assessment," and the charge to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act Scientific Advisory Panel (FIFRA SAP) for the January 28, 2014, SAP meeting.<br />
	The agency will consult with the SAP on the EPA’s approach to assess the risk of RNAi gene silencing technology for pesticidal purposes.</p>

<p><strong>Updated Notice of Arrival of Pesticides and Devices Form (EPA Form 3540-1)</strong><br />
	The EPA has now updated the form for Notice of Arrival (NOA) of Pesticides and Devices that is required for importing pesticides and pesticidal devices into the United States. These revisions should increase the efficiency of the Notice of Arrival process.</p>

	Officials from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will present a grant for more than $167,000 to Dr. Kristen Healy of the Louisiana State University AgCenter at a ceremony on Wednesday, January 8. The grant will fund a study to assess the impact of mosquito-control methods on honey bees.<br />
	The study will look at development and application of insecticides used to control adult mosquito populations to minimize impacts on honey bee health. The LSU team will use the study results to develop specific guidelines for safely using these insecticides, and to assist beekeepers in minimizing exposure of bee colonies.</p>
