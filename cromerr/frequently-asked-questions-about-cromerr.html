<ul class="accordion"><li><a class="accordion-title" href="../node/79583.html#pane-1">What is CROMERR?</a>

		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-1">
			<p>CROMERR stands for the Cross-Media Electronic Reporting Rule. It provides the legal framework for electronic reporting under Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations to EPA and state, tribalÂ and local governments that are authorized to administer federal programs. The regulation authorizes and facilitates electronic reporting for environmental programs while maintaining the level of corporate and individual responsibility and accountability that exists for paper submissions.</p>

			<p>For more, see: <a href="../node/71371.html">Learn About the Cross-Media Electronic Reporting Rule</a></p>
		</div>
	</li>
	<li><a class="accordion-title" href="../node/79583.html#pane-2">Does CROMERR require electronic reporting?</a>
		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-2">
			<p>No. CROMERR does not mandate that authorized programsÂ institute electronic reporting or accept documents electronically. It also does not require that regulated entities use electronic reporting for reporting directly to EPA.</p>

			<p>However, CROMERR does not prohibit authorized programsÂ from requiring electronic reporting if they otherwise possess the authority to mandate electronic reporting.</p>
		</div>
	</li>
	<li><a class="accordion-title" href="../node/79583.html#pane-3">Does CROMERR apply to all reporting that uses electronic media or related technology?</a>
		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-3">
			<p>No. CROMERR does not affect the submission of any electronic document via magnetic or optical media (e.g., diskette, compact disk or tape) or via fax.</p>

			<p>This exemption does not mean that faxes, CDs, etc. received can be discarded. They should be kept as the record copy. EPA would also advise that physical media be submitted with a wet-ink-on-paper signature document that is retained together with the submitted materials.;</p>

			<p>Please also note that CROMERR places no limitations on programs taking regulatory data submitted by any means and typing, loading, scanning, etc. it into another system as a âworkingâ copy of the data or allowing otherwise non-CROMERR compliant submissions to be maintained as âworkingâ or âcourtesyâ copies of data so long as paper-based, CROMERR-compliant or exempted records of this data are separately retained as the official copies of record.</p>

		</div>
	</li>
	<li><a class="accordion-title" href="../node/79583.html#pane-4">What regulatory programs are affected by CROMERR?</a>
		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-4">
			<p>CROMERR affects all regulatory programs that EPA implements under Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), and all state, tribal and local government programs authorized by EPA under Title 40 of the CFR.</p>
		</div>
	</li>
	<li><a class="accordion-title" href="../node/79583.html#pane-5">How does CROMERR affect authorized programs?</a>
		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-5">
			<p>CROMERR affects authorized programs in a number of ways. It requires authorized programs to seek EPA approval of program modifications or revisions if they implement or wish to implement electronic reporting under their authorized programs.</p>

			<ul><li>CROMERR sets requirements for electronic reporting under authorized programs, including standards for the systems that authorized programs use to receive electronic reports.</li>
				<li>It establishes a special, streamlined approval process for revisions or modifications to authorized programs related to electronic reporting.</li>
			</ul></div>
	</li>
	<li><a class="accordion-title" href="../node/79583.html#pane-6">Does CROMERR affect all data transfers from authorized programs to EPA?</a>
		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-6">
			<p>No. CROMERR does not apply to data transfers between EPA and authorized programsÂ or administrative arrangements between authorized programs and EPA to share data. For example, if an authorized program is collecting data in a CROMERR-compliant or CROMERR-exempt way, the act of thatÂ authorized program sharing that data electronically with other authorized programs or EPA is not subject to CROMERR.</p>

			<p>For more information, see: <a href="does-cromerr-apply-your-e-reporting-system.html">Does CROMERR Apply to Your E-Reporting System?</a></p>
		</div>
	</li>
	<li><a class="accordion-title" href="../node/79583.html#pane-7">Does the rule cover electronic record-keeping?</a>
		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-7">
			<p>No, with the exception of the requirement to maintain a "copy of record" for those reports filed electronically. Although the proposed rule included provisions for electronic record-keeping, EPA is not issuing final record-keeping rules at this time.</p>
		</div>
	</li>
	<li><a class="accordion-title" href="../node/79583.html#pane-8">When do authorized program electronic reporting systems need EPA approval?</a>
		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-8">
			<p>Authorized programs need EPA approval for electronic reporting systems when those systems collect regulatory data under 40 CFR, and when those systems maintain the official copy of record electronically in lieu of on paper.</p>
		</div>
	</li>
	<li><a class="accordion-title" href="../node/79583.html#pane-9">Are there other data or information management requirements that CROMERR does not address?</a>
		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-9">CROMERR does not:
			<ul><li>Change any substantive regulatory requirements that appear in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations,</li>
				<li>Change any substantive regulatory requirements under authorized state programs,</li>
				<li>Confer any right or privilege to submit data electronically,</li>
				<li>Require any state program to accept electronic documents, nor</li>
				<li>Require signatures on electronic documents if Title 40 does not require signatures on the corresponding paper documents.</li>
			</ul></div>
	</li>
	<li><a class="accordion-title" href="../node/79583.html#pane-10">What are CROMERR priority reports?</a>
		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-10">
			<p>Priority Reports areÂ regulatory reporting requirements codified under 40 CFRÂ thatÂ EPA has identified as likely to be material to potential enforcement litigation. Priority reports are listed in Appendix 1 of the CROMERR rule at 40 CFR part 3. Not all CROMERR priority reports are delegable; many priority reports are directly reported to EPA. If a report does not appear in Appendix C, it is a non-priority report. The CROMERR rule did not separately list non-priority reports. Regulatory reporting requirements codified under 40 CFR but not listed in Appendix C are still subject to CROMERR requirements if the information will be collected electronically in lieu of paper as the copy of record.</p>

			<p>The primary difference between a system that collects priority reports and a system that collects non-priority reports is that the former system must determine identity before the electronic signature is received, and the process for doing so must satisfy prescribed requirements in CROMERR. Identity proofing for a system that collects non-priority reports can occur after the electronic signature is received.</p>

			<p>Some CROMERR applicants have successfully applied two different identity-proofing standards in one system, but most opt for the higher standard if it is required for some of the reports being collected by the system. In certain cases, too, the CROMERR programÂ hasÂ determined that theÂ use of past, signed paper documents on file from regulated entitiesÂ sufficientlyÂ meetsÂ identity-proofing requirements.</p>

			<p>For a list of priority reports, see: <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2005/10/13/05-19601/cross-media-electronic-reporting#h-68">CROMERR Rule, Appendix 1</a><br />
				For information about identity proofing requirements for both priority and non-priority reports, see: <a href="lesson-5-priority-vs-non-priority-reports.html">CROMERR 101 Lesson 5: Priority vs. non-priority reports</a></p>
		</div>
	</li>
	<li><a class="accordion-title" href="../node/79583.html#pane-11">Does receiving report submissions via email meet CROMERR requirements?</a>
		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-11">
			<p>Attaching reports to emails is not considered to be a CROMERR-compliant system as it fails meet numerous CROMERR requirements, namely:</p>

			<ul><li>The document is not alterable without detection</li>
				<li>Alterations to the document are recorded by the system</li>
				<li>The document can only be submitted intentionally</li>
				<li>Submitters and signatories are provided with an opportunity to review and repudiate the COR</li>
			</ul><p>In addition, scanned signatures are not considered to be valid e-signatures. A valid electronic signature refers to an electronic document that has been signed using an electronic signature device. The identified signatory is uniquely entitled to use the signature device for signing that document provided that this device has not been compromised, and the signatory is an individual who is authorized to sign the document by virtue of his or her legal status and his or her relationship to the regulated entity on whose behalf the signature is executed.</p>

			<p>Please note that CROMERR places no limitations on programs taking regulatory data submitted by any means and typing, loading, scanning, etc. it into another system as a âworkingâ copy of the data or allowing otherwise non-CROMERR compliant submissions to be maintained as âworkingâ or âcourtesyâ copies of data so long as paper-based, CROMERR-compliant or exempted records of this data are separately retained as the official copies of record. But email alone would not suffice as a CROMERR-compliant copy of record.</p>

	<li><a class="accordion-title" href="../node/79583.html#pane-12">Does receiving report submissions via a file upload process meet CROMERR requirements?</a>
		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-12">
			<p>Receiving report submissions via a file upload process could be a CROMERR-compliant solution or submission via file upload can be part of a CROMERR-compliant solution. CROMERR was specifically designed as a set of performance-based standards to allow for the evolution of technology and business process approaches continuing to suggest new ways of meeting CROMERR requirements.</p>

			<p>An electronic reporting system that receives submissions via a file upload process is likely to face the following challenges in terms of CROMERR compliance:</p>

			<ul><li>If signature is required, is the signature one that complies with CROMERR?</li>
				<li>If signature is required, how is the signature bound to the document?</li>
				<li>If signature is required, what is the second authenticating factor?</li>
				<li>What evidence is there that the document hasnât been modified since the time it was signed / submitted?</li>
				<li>How does the system demonstrate an intent by the registrant to submit a particular document?</li>
				<li>How does the system acknowledge receipt of the document?</li>
				<li>What opportunity is there to review and repudiate a posted document?</li>
				<li>How does the system guard against errors in transmission?</li>
			</ul><p>Note that scanned signatures are not considered to be valid e-signatures. A valid electronic signature refers to an electronic document that has been signed using an electronic signature device. The identified signatory is uniquely entitled to use the signature device for signing that document provided that this device has not been compromised, and the signatory is an individual who is authorized to sign the document by virtue of his or her legal status and his or her relationship to the regulated entity on whose behalf the signature is executed.</p>

			<p>Please note, too, that CROMERR places no limitations on programs taking regulatory data submitted by any means and typing, loading, scanning, etc. it into another system as a âworkingâ copy of the data or allowing otherwise non-CROMERR compliant submissions to be maintained as âworkingâ or âcourtesyâ copies of data so long as paper-based, CROMERR-compliant or exempted records of this data are separately retained as the official copies of record.</p>

	<li><a class="accordion-title" href="../node/79583.html#pane-13">Are fax-to-email or email-to-fax submissions exempt from CROMERR?</a>
		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-13">
			<p>Fax-to-email and email-to-fax in lieu of paper-based submissions do not fall under the fax exemption from CROMERR, which is intended only for fax-to-fax submissions.</p>

			<p>Fax-to-email and email-to-fax in lieu of paper-based submissions are not CROMERR compliant means of electronic reporting. Without a CROMERR-compliant means for collecting electronically, these submission methods are only acceptable for courtesy copies. A paper-based copy with an ink-on-paper signature must separately be received by mail and maintained as the official copy of record.</p>

		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-14">
			<p>Authorized programs seeking to meet the requirements should consult the actual language of section VI.E of the Preamble and Â§3.2000(b) of the rule for more detail. The subject areas addressed by the requirements include:</p>

			<ul><li>Timeliness of data generation,</li>
				<li>Copy of record,</li>
				<li>Integrity of the electronic document,</li>
				<li>Submission knowingly with intent and not by accident,</li>

	<li><a class="accordion-title" href="../node/79583.html#pane-15">Does CROMERR require specific technical or business process approaches?</a>
		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-15">
			<p>No. CROMERR was specifically designed as a set of performance-based standards to allow for the evolution of technology and business process approaches continuing to suggest new and novel ways of meeting CROMERR requirements. New and novel approaches often involve additional review, but the program welcomes their consideration.</p>
		</div>
	</li>
	<li><a class="accordion-title" href="../node/79583.html#pane-16">What CROMERR requirements apply if a system has no signature capability or no electronic signature?</a>
		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-16">
			<p>Some systems do not have a signature capability because they are designed only to collect reports which are not required to be signed. Typically, these are drinking water electronic reporting systems.</p>

			<p>Other systems have chosen only to implement a paper-based signature document which is mailed in after the report is submitted electronically. In these situations, not all CROMERR requirements must be addressed.</p>

		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-17">
			<p>CROMERR does not dictate who signs or whether a particular report needs to be signed. Authorized program regulations as well as state and local statutes specify this. Â§ 3.2000(b)(5)(vii) of CROMERR requires that applicants document a business or system process for determining that users who will sign reports are authorized to do so on behalf of the specified regulated entities.</p>

			<p>Questions regarding how to set this process so that it complies with authorized-program regulations should be directed to staff coordinating that program in the EPA Regions or at headquarters.</p>

			<p>Off-the-shelf solutions designed for specific authorized-program reporting needs typically address most if not all of both the CROMERR and the program requirements around this element.</p>

	<li><a class="accordion-title" href="../node/79583.html#pane-18">Why does CROMERR require a paper-based subscriber agreement?</a>
		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-18">
			<p>CROMERR does not require that the subscriber agreement / signature agreement be paper-based. This is a system design choice that typically results from the identity-proofing process being done manually.</p>

			<p>CROMERR requires that systems collecting priority reports listed in Appendix 1 of the CROMERR rule determine identity before the electronic signature is received, and one means of accomplishing this is through a subscriber agreement / signature agreement. Electronic identity-proofing is another option, and systems using electronic identity proofing typically employ a paperless subscriber agreement / signature agreement.</p>

			<p>For more information about electronic signature agreements, see: <a href="cromerr-electronic-signature-agreement-guide.html">CROMERR Electronic Signature Agreement</a></p>

			<p>CDX Shared CROMERR Services offers electronic identity proofing, or authorized programs can pursue their own means of electronic identity proofing.</p>

	<li><a class="accordion-title" href="../node/79583.html#pane-19">Does CROMERR require systems to use a challenge question "second-factor" authentication approach for e-signatures?</a>
		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-19">
			<p>No, but CROMERR does require an approach that demonstrates that e-signatures are valid as defined by the rule. Among other things, a valid PIN/password-based e-signature needs to demonstrate that the PIN (or password) has not been compromised. The CROMERR Preamble suggests that where an e-signature is executed with a PIN (or password), preventing device compromise requires a second "factor" that is not easy to share by accident or one the owner is likely not to wish to share.<br /><br />
				For more information, see: <a href="user-identification-verification-and-authentication-challenge-question-second-factor.html">User Identification, Verification, and Authentication: Challenge Question Second-Factor Approach</a></p>
		</div>
	</li>
	<li><a class="accordion-title" href="../node/79583.html#pane-20">Is the challenge question approach the only âsecond factorâ available to strengthen a PIN/password-based e-signature?</a>
		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-20">
			<p>No, candidate second-factors include private knowledge (such as a "challenge question"), biometrics and hardware devices (e.g., smart cards, USBs, PIN/Password Generators, RSA tokens, cell phones).</p>

			<p>EPA recommends PIN-based e-signatures use a "challenge question" as a "second factor" because compared with the alternatives, the challenge-question approach provides significant added protection against signature repudiation at a relatively low cost. The approach is relatively inexpensive, easy to implement and is widely used for commercial applications such as banking.</p>

			<p>States are welcome to propose other options that demonstrate that the PIN/password has not been compromised.<br /><br />

	<li><a class="accordion-title" href="../node/79583.html#pane-21">When a system uses a challenge question as a "second factor" to strengthen a PIN/password-based e-signature, how many challenge-questions need to be presented to users each time they enter their PIN or password to execute a signature?</a>
		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-21">
			<p>A single challenge-question is usually sufficient. It should be randomly selected from the set of questions for which the user has provided pre-arranged answers, so that the user cannot predict which question will be presented in any particular case.</p>
		</div>
	</li>
	<li><a class="accordion-title" href="../node/79583.html#pane-22">To set up a challenge-question "second factor" approach, how many questions does the user need to provide with prearranged answers?</a>
		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-22">
			<p>Five pre-arranged question-answer pairs are usually sufficient to allow the system to present a single question in a truly unpredictable way to a user who is executing an e-signature. Any less than five prearranged question-answer pairs are too few to allow meaningful unpredictability.</p>
		</div>
	</li>
	<li><a class="accordion-title" href="../node/79583.html#pane-23">When asking users to select questions to provide with prearranged answers, how long should the list of candidate questions be from which users get to choose?</a>
		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-23">
			<p>The answer depends on the nature of prearranged question-answer pairs and on how many questions there will be. Where there will be five prearranged question-answer pairs, then a list of ten candidate questions may be sufficient, although EPA recommends twenty candidate questions, to give users the best chance of finding five questions they can answer with certainty from memory. If there will be more than five question-answer pairs, then a longer list may be needed.<br /><br />
				Typically, the list of candidate questions needs to be significantly longer than the number of questions to be given prearranged answers, because questions that address the private knowledge of some users may not be a suitable question for all users. It is possible that a relatively short list of candidate questions that consist entirely of questions suitable to all users may meet the requirements of a challenge-question implementation.</p>

		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-32">
			<p>The CROMERR approval process allows authorized programs to submit a single application for a system that collects under more than one authorized program. CROMERR provides a single EPA review and program modification process for multi-program electronic reporting systems.

		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-35">
			<p>EPAâs traditional, formal assessment of CROMERR applications is a two-step process.</p>

			<p>This process first includes a âcompleteness reviewâ to determine whether the application supplies enough information to determine compliance with the CROMERR performance-based requirements provided under Â§3.2000(b) of 40 CFR Part 3.</p>

			<p>The second step is âapproval reviewâ, which assesses actual compliance with these requirements.The entire process is designed to assure the authenticity and integrity of electronic documents so that they will meet the Agencyâs legal and business needs to the same extent as their paper counterparts.</p>

			<p>For many off-the-shelf solutions this two-step process is conducted simultaneously if a technical review is required at all.</p>

		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-36">
			<p>For applications that EPA deems incomplete, the Agency will notify to the applicant about the applicationâs deficiencies. Authorized programs can then either withdraw their application and re-submit a new application, or they may submit an amended application.</p>

			<p>EPA has 75 calendar days to respond to the resubmitted new application with a completeness determination and 30 calendar days to respond to an amended application with a completeness determination.</p>

	<li><a class="accordion-title" href="../node/79583.html#pane-38">When can an authorized program begin using its electronic reporting system?</a>
		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-38">
			<p>If ready for use, the authorized program can begin having regulated entities register to system and submit reports the same day that EPA publishes a notice of the approval in the Federal Register. Drinking water systems or drinking water reporting, though, cannot collect reports until typically 30 days after the publication date.</p>

</ul><h3>Special Provisions</h3>

<ul class="accordion"><li><a class="accordion-title" href="../node/79583.html#pane-39">Are there special provisions for public water system programs?</a>

		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-39">
			<p>Yes. When applying to report electronically for a public water system program under 40 CFR Part 142, EPA must provide the opportunity for a public hearing.</p>

			<p>Once EPA makes a preliminary determination for the application, EPA will publish a notice in the Federal Register. Requests for hearings must be submitted to EPA within 30 days after publication.</p>

			<p>If a hearing is requested, EPA will conduct a hearing and issue an order either affirming or rescinding its preliminary determination, and will publish a Final Notice in the Federal Register. If no hearing is requested, EPA's preliminary determination will be effective 30 days after the first notice was published.</p>

		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-40">
			<p>Authorized-program applicants using off-the-shelf solutions and all Shared CROMERR Services components benefit from significantly reduced application requirements and fast-tracked approval typically withinÂ 6 toÂ 12 months. The CROMERR program is able to offer streamlined review and approval for these solutions because it has worked with EPA programs and commercial vendors to assess the core CROMERR aspects of these solutions, which typically do not vary among implementations. As a result, very little or sometimes even nothing is left for the authorized-program to document in terms of the solution.</p>

			<p>CROMERR is a rule and not a software certification program. So, authorized-programs pursuing these solutions must still submit CROMERR applications requesting EPA to take action under 40 CFR part 3. Depending upon the solution, this application may simply be a notification of the intent to implement the solution.</p>

	<li><a class="accordion-title" href="../node/79583.html#pane-41">How are publicly-owned pretreatment works (POTW) pretreatment program applications for electronic reporting handled?</a>
		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-41">
			<p>POTW pretreatment programs should prepare applications using materials such as the CROMERR system checklists and the guidance document for preparing CROMERR legal certifications. However, in addition to addressing CROMERR requirements, their applications must also address additional electronic reporting requirements outlined under 40 CFR part 403. It may be that some of these additional requirements are addressed in the CROMERR checklist or supporting documentation, and a crosswalk identifying where to find them would be sufficient.</p>

			<p>The POTW pretreatment program should send the application to EPA by emailing it to both <a href="mailto:CromerrPOTWrequest@epa.gov">CromerrPOTWrequest@epa.gov</a> and <a href="mailto:cromerr@epa.gov">cromerr@epa.gov</a>.</p>

			<p>Hard-copy application file submissions are generally not necessary; though, the POTW pretreatment program approval authority may request a hard-copy of the legal certification. If attempting to send application files larger than 8 MB, please contact <a href="mailto:cromerr@epa.gov">cromerr@epa.gov</a> to arrange for transfer. The POTW pretreatment program also notifies its pretreatment approval authority (state or EPA) of the intent to modify its program legal authority and procedures in order to receive reports electronically.</p>

			<p>The CROMERR program conducts a courtesy review of the checklist and works with the applicant as necessary to address any possible CROMERR compliance concerns. Once the system is determined to be CROMERR compliant, the CROMERR program advises the applicant and the approval authority that CROMERR system requirements have been met. The POTW pretreatment programâs approval authority takes action on the program modification request once it determines that the additional electronic reporting requirements under 40 CFR part 403 have been met.</p>

			<p>POTW pretreatment programs should contact the CROMERR program with questions regarding CROMERR requirements, assistance in preparing applications, and technical assistance with system design choices to meet CROMERR requirements. Questions regarding 40 CFR part 403 electronic reporting requirements should be addressed to the EPA pretreatment program.</p>

		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-44">
			<p>âSignificantâ changes are those that affect system functionality described in the approved application.</p>

			<p>Examples of significant changes could include changes to the types of file formats that affect how the copy of record (COR) is maintained, as well as changes to the technologies that may be used for file transfer or for creating electronic signatures on transmitted reports. Generally, changes in the steps involved in transmitting electronic reports, changes to the registration or credentialing process, and changes to the COR, including its maintenance and accessibility, will amount to significant changes.</p>

	<li><a class="accordion-title" href="../node/79583.html#pane-45">Are there system changes that approved authorized-program applicants do not need to notify EPA about?</a>
		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-45">
			<p>Yes. Typically, authorized programs do not need to notify EPA:</p>

			<ul><li>when implementing any planned system upgrade(s) outlined in their approved applications.</li>
				<li>when they begin to flow reports which are covered by their application approval.</li>
			</ul><p>Exception: if there are changes to the planned upgrade(s) and/or changes related to new reports beginning to flow that may affect CROMERR compliance.</p>

			<p>Additionally, authorized programs do not need to notify EPA about bug fixes, even if those fixes relate to functionality described in the approved application. Such changes may range from fixing a typo on a data entry screen to re-engineering the systemâs archiving routines.</p>

		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-46">
			<p>EPAâs process is described in the document <em>Notification and Approval of Changes to Approved CROMERR Applications: For States, Tribes, and Local Governments</em>.</p>

			<p>For more information, see: <a href="notification-and-approval-changes-approved-cromerr-applications-states-tribes-and-local.html">Notification and Approval of Changes to Approved CROMERR Applications: For States, Tribes, and Local Governments</a></p>

	<li><a class="accordion-title" href="../node/79583.html#pane-47">How quickly does EPA evaluate changes to approved electronic reporting systems?</a>
		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-47">
			<p>EPAÂ makes determinations on a case-by-case basis, and the time-frame for such determinations varies depending on the extent and complexity of the changes. Most changes are evaluated and a determination made within 3-6 weeks. However, âsignificantâ changes which trigger a new application and/or interpretation by EPA legal counsel will take longer.</p>
		</div>
	</li>
	<li><a class="accordion-title" href="../node/79583.html#pane-48">Can authorized programs implement the proposed change(s) while awaiting EPA's determination?</a>
		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-48">
			<p>Authorized programs can implement elements of the proposed change(s) which are unrelated to approved CROMERR functionality and/or business processes.Â They may also proceed to design and develop elements of the proposed change(s) that have already been evaluated by EPA. To avoid potential rework, authorized programs should not proceed to design and develop elements of the proposed change(s) that are still being evaluated by EPA.</p>

			<p>Authorized programs must obtain an EPA approval determination before putting the proposed change(s) into production. This approval determination is typically an email from EPA, but may be a letter and/or Federal Register notice in the case of âsignificantâ changes or certain new reporting. EPA recognizes that there may be instances where an authorized program may need to change its approved system to make ââemergencyââ changes (e.g., upgrading system firewall protection), and EPA will strive to expedite the determination process in these cases.</p>

	</li>
	<li><a class="accordion-title" href="../node/79583.html#pane-49">Must authorized-program applicants notify EPA if they plan to flow their approved reporting into a new system?</a>
		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-49">
			<p>Yes. Prior approval of a system for reporting under one or more authorized programs does not permit some or all of this reporting to be transferred to a different system. Typically, a new CROMERR application and EPA approval action is required. A possible exception would be if the new system in question is not providing any CROMERR functionality; the CROMERR functionality is still provided, without changes, by the system previously approved.</p>

	<li><a class="accordion-title" href="../node/79583.html#pane-50">Must approved authorized-program applicants notify EPA of plans for additional reporting into their approved systems?</a>
		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-50">
			<p>Generally, approved applicantsÂ do not need to notify EPA if all of the followingÂ is true:</p>

			<ul><li>there are no changes to approved CROMERR functionality and/or business processes of the system(s)Â as a result of the additional reporting;</li>
				<li>the additional reporting falls under an EPA-authorized program already modified/revised for electronic reporting under the system's previous approval(s); and</li>
				<li>the approved system(s) provides functionality required for the proposed additional reportingÂ (e.g., an applicant cannot simply add a report that requires signature to a system that does not provide for signatures nor add a CROMERR priority report to a system that was only designed for non-priority reports).</li>
			</ul><p>Further, if a particular report was notÂ included authorized-program applicant's prior systemÂ approval, thereÂ is no need to correct the approval action unless the report omitted is under an EPA-authorized program also not included in EPA approval action.</p>

			<p>Approved authorized-program applicants planning to add additional regulatory report(s) under EPA-authorized program(s) <strong>NOT</strong> previously modified/revised for electronic reporting with their systemâs previous approval(s)Â <strong>DO</strong> need to notify EPA because, while typically no review is required, EPA must approve this additionalÂ programÂ via a Federal Register notice.</p>

		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-51">
			<p>The CROMERR program works directly with EPA programs and commercial off-the-shelf (OTS) software vendors to evaluate and document changes to the software productsâ core CROMERR functionality and/or business processes. For products used by several authorized programs, approved applicants are not required to notify EPA of such changes.</p>

			<p>EPA or the vendor would notify customers if they undergo changes that will trigger related changes to CROMERR functionality and/or business processes. Approved applicants using a software product exclusively must notify EPA of any system changes that have the potential to affect compliance with CROMERR.</p>

			<p>Approved authorized-program applicants implementing CDXâs Lexis Nexis identity proofing component do not need to notify the CROMERR program of this change, nor does the CROMERR program need to approve this change.

<ul class="accordion"><li><a class="accordion-title" href="../node/79583.html#pane-53">Are EPA programs required to notify the CROMERR program of changes to their approved electronic reporting system(s) which may affect CROMERR compliance?</a>

		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-53">
			<p>Not typically. While EPA programs are not subject to the formal review and approval processes for authorized-program applications, they are required to maintain the CROMERR compliance of their systems. However, most EPA programs rely almost entirely on Central Data Exchange (CDX) components to meet CROMERR functionality and business process requirements. The CROMERR program works directly with CDX and to evaluate and document changes to its core CROMERR functionality and/or business processes. Further, EPA programs may freely switch from one approved CDX CROMERR component to another for their approved system without notifying the CROMERR program.</p>

			<p>On occasion an EPA program requests special customizations to CDX functionality and/or business processes; typically these customizations will need to be reviewed and approved by the CROMERR program.</p>
