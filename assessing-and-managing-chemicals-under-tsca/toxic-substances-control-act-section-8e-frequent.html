		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-1">
			<p>"Substantial risk" is defined in Part V of the 2003 TSCA §8(e) Reporting Guidance as a risk of considerable concern because of (a) the seriousness of the effect, and (b) the fact or probability of its occurrence. Unlike "unreasonable risk" under TSCA, economic or social benefits of use or costs of restricting use are not considered when determining whether there is reasonable support for a conclusion of "substantial risk" for purposes of §8(e).</p>

	<li><a class="accordion-title" href="toxic-substances-control-act-section-8e-frequent.html#pane-2" title="Click to expand description">Q.2. If a company obtains new human exposure-related information on a chemical it manufactures, such as blood or urine monitoring data on a chemical known to have serious toxic effects, is it reportable under TSCA §8(e)?</a>
		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-2">
			<p>Yes. If the new information on a chemical known to have serious toxic effects indicates a level of exposure previously unknown to the Administrator, it should be reported. Information that corroborates known exposure levels, such as those within the range of chemical blood levels and other biological monitoring data recorded in the NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) data base, is not reportable. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s “National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals” derived from NHANES is available at: <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/exposurereport">http://www.cdc.gov/exposurereport</a>.</p>

<ul class="accordion"><li><a class="accordion-title" href="toxic-substances-control-act-section-8e-frequent.html#pane-3" title="Click to expand description">Q.3. Does the TSCA §8(e) reporting obligation include the requirement to actively search for substantial risk information or to request it if a person knows of such information that is not in his or her possession?</a>

		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-3">
			<p>TSCA §8(e) applies to information that a person possesses or has obtained. It is not intended to compel searches for information or extraordinary efforts to acquire information. However, "known" information includes information that a prudent person similarly situated could reasonably be expected to know. Negligence or intentional avoidance of information does not release a person from his or her TSCA §8(e) obligation.</p>
		</div>
	</li>
	<li><a class="accordion-title" href="toxic-substances-control-act-section-8e-frequent.html#pane-4" title="Click to expand description">Q.4. What is the time requirement for reporting supplemental information obtained after an initial TSCA §8(e) notification or for responding to an EPA inquiry for additional information following a §8(e) notice?</a>
		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-4">
			<p>The information should be reported to EPA within 30 calendar days, the same as the initial §8(e) reporting requirement, unless additional time for reporting has been granted.</p>
		</div>
	</li>
	<li><a class="accordion-title" href="toxic-substances-control-act-section-8e-frequent.html#pane-5" title="Click to expand description">Q.5. Is the TSCA §8(e) guidance issued by EPA binding on persons subject to this reporting requirement?</a>
		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-5">
			<p>No. While the need to report substantial risk information to EPA under TSCA §8(e) is a binding requirement (pursuant to TSCA §15(3)(B)), the policies outlined in the guidance are not a binding requirement. The June 3, 2003, TSCA §8(e) Policy Statement and Guidance (68 FR 33137) sets forth Agency guidance to aid in complying with this section of TSCA, but the §8(e) guidance published or publicized by the Agency does not impose any binding requirements on the regulated community. The June 3, 2003 guidance document articulates EPA's preferences for how and where TSCA §8(e) notices should be submitted, but it does not obligate submitters to comply with these preferences. Persons with general or specific questions on the applicability of TSCA §8(e) are welcome to contact EPA. In responding to inquiries, EPA will consider the June 3, 2003, Reporting Guidance but this guidance will not be determinative. The Agency will also consider this guidance for enforcement purposes.</p>

	<li><a class="accordion-title" href="toxic-substances-control-act-section-8e-frequent.html#pane-6" title="Click to expand description">Q.6. If a company has several health and safety studies on different chemicals to submit under TSCA §8(e) as a result of an acquisition or self-audit, should they be submitted to EPA as a single TSCA §8(e) submission with endpoints consolidated by chemical?</a>
		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-6">
			<p>No. EPA prefers that separate submissions be provided for each chemical substance or mixture. For example, including more than one study report per submission relating to a particular chemical or mixture is acceptable, whereas submitting studies on different chemicals in a single TSCA §8(e) submission is not appropriate. Studies on different chemicals should be submitted as different TSCA §8(e) submissions because it would be cumbersome to track many chemicals per submission in EPA's document tracking systems, such as the Toxic Substances Control Act Test Submissions (TSCATS) data base. The same reasoning applies to "For Your Information" (FYI) voluntary submissions, which should also be submitted separately for each chemical.</p>

		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-7">

<h3><a id="info" name="info"></a>Information "Known to the Administrator"</h3>

<ul class="accordion"><li><a class="accordion-title" href="toxic-substances-control-act-section-8e-frequent.html#pane-8" title="Click to expand description">Q.8. Does EPA consider releases reported to the National Response Center (NRC) "known to the Administrator" for TSCA §8(e) purposes?</a>

		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-8">
			<p>Yes. But under TSCA §8(e), only <strong>emergency</strong> incidents of environmental contamination should be reported to the NRC. As explained in Part IX. (f) of the June 3, 2003, Republication of TSCA Section 8(e) Policy Statement and Guidance, persons should report emergency incidents of environmental contamination (Part V. (c)) to either the EPA Administrator or to the NRC by telephone as soon as obtaining knowledge of the incident. Information properly filed as emergency reports to either of these parties need not be reported further under TSCA § 8(e). However, any new substantial risk information concerning the incident that is later obtained is reportable under TSCA §8(e). Non-emergency situations involving environmental contamination (Part V. (b)(1)) do not require reporting to the NRC under TSCA §8(e), but subject persons should report environmental contamination information to the EPA Administrator within 30 calendar days of obtaining it if it meets TSCA §8(e) reporting criteria. Information otherwise required to be reported to EPA, other federal regulatory agencies or states with delegated programs within 90 days for non-emergency situations involving environmental contamination or within 30 days for other types of information described under Part V.(a) and (b) need not be separately reported under TSCA §8(e). Examples of mandatory reports to the National Response Center or other authorities under a federal statute that need not be reported under TSCA §8(e) include:</p>

			<ul><li>Reports of releases of reportable quantities (RQs) of CERCLA §102(a) hazardous substances (reportable under 40 CFR part 302);</li>
				<li>Reports of spills to navigable waters or adjoining shorelines of oil in quantities that may be harmful to public health or welfare, or to the environment, under the Clean Water Act and Oil Pollution Act (reportable under 40 CFR part 110 for oil discharges and 40 CFR 116 for hazardous substances discharges); and</li>
				<li>Reports of incidents involving hazardous materials regulated by the Department of Transportation under the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act (reportable under 49 CFR part 171 for the transportation of hazardous materials, 49 CFR part 191 for natural gas and other gases transported by pipeline, and 49 CFR 195 for liquids transported by pipeline).</li>
			</ul></div>
	</li>
	<li><a class="accordion-title" href="toxic-substances-control-act-section-8e-frequent.html#pane-9" title="Click to expand description">Q.9. Part VII. (f) of the June 3, 2003, Republication of TSCA Section 8(e) Policy Statement and Guidance states that substantial risk information need not be reported under TSCA §8(e) if it "is information of the kind under Part V. (b)(1) and (c) submitted to the Federal government or a state that is developed in connection with an authorized (by the relevant Federal or state authority) site remediation program." What is an authorized (by the relevant Federal or state authority) site remediation program?</a>
		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-9">
			<p>EPA considers all federal and state corrective actions, monitoring, cleanup and remediation programs as "authorized site remediation programs" if such programs are established and enforced under federal or state laws or programs under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) or the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). These activities include site remediation undertaken voluntarily but with state knowledge under a specific, authorized state program, as well as remediation activities conducted pursuant to orders or enforceable agreements.</p>
		</div>
	</li>
	<li><a class="accordion-title" href="toxic-substances-control-act-section-8e-frequent.html#pane-10" title="Click to expand description">Q.10. EPA manages the Underground Storage Tank (UST) program (40 CFR Part 280) by approving state programs to operate in lieu of the Federal program. Some state programs are approved by the Agency and some are operating under a "Memorandum of Agreement" with EPA. Is reporting to a state UST program operating under either of these conditions considered "known to the Administrator"?</a>
		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-10">
			<p>Yes. All information submitted to states under an UST program approved by or operating under a "Memorandum of Agreement" with EPA is considered "known to the (EPA) Administrator". Such information does not need to be reported under TSCA §8(e), as long as it is reported within the timeframes stated in Part VII. (d) of the June 3, 2003, Reporting Guidance (i.e., within 90 days for non-emergency contamination situations; immediately for emergency incidents of environmental contamination; and within 30 days for other substantial risk information).</p>

	<li><a class="accordion-title" href="toxic-substances-control-act-section-8e-frequent.html#pane-11" title="Click to expand description">Q.11. A chemical plant does toxicity testing on plant effluents to monitor the quality of treated wastewater to comply with permit requirements under the Clean Water Act (CWA). Are the results of such testing reportable under TSCA §8(e)?</a>
		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-11">
			<p>No. Any significant toxicity findings in this context are presumed to be reportable to federal or authorized state permit authorities under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) requirements within appropriate timeframes and are covered under Part VII. (c) and (d) of the 2003 TSCA Section 8(e) Reporting Guidance regarding information that need not be reported under TSCA §8(e). However, reporting under TSCA §8(e) should be considered if additional information on the plant effluents, such as unexpected persistence, bioaccumulation or widespread contamination, are available that were not considered in setting the CWA permit.</p>

If EPA shares responsibility for implementing a program (e.g., sharing primacy under the Underground Injection Control Program or a site remediation program), does reporting to the state under these programs fall within the exemption for TSCA §8(e) reporting outlined in Part VII. (d) of the 2003 TSCA Section 8(e) Reporting Guidance?</a>
		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-12">
			<p>Yes. Such programs are considered authorized or delegated programs for purposes of <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=EPA-HQ-OPPT-2002-0067-0001">Part VII. (d) of the 2003 TSCA Section 8(e) Reporting Guidance</a>.</p>

Does reporting to state emergency response committees (SERCs) and local emergency response committees (LEPCs) fall under the category of information that need not be reported under TSCA §8(e)?</a>
		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-13">

		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-16">
			<p>TSCA §3(8) defines a "health and safety study" as “any study of any effect of a chemical substance or mixture on health or the environment or on both, including underlying information and epidemiological studies, studies of occupational exposure to a chemical or mixture, toxicological, clinical, and ecological studies of a chemical or mixture, and any test performed pursuant to [TSCA].” Therefore, incident information, exposure studies, and their other underlying information (including underlying data) should be considered covered under the term "health and safety study."</p>

		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-17">
			<p>Any information, including preliminary information, from human health and safety studies and animal studies on a chemical in commerce that implicates the tested chemical causes toxic effects when there is also an exposure concern should be reported to EPA under TSCA §8(e). The decision to report should not hinge in any way on a judgment about the relevance of the findings to an assessment of human risk. For the most serious toxic effects (e.g., cancer, neurotoxicity, birth defects), the decision to report should not even depend on a judgment of actual or potential exposure to the chemical. The mere fact that the chemical is in commerce constitutes sufficient evidence of exposure.

		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-18">
			<p>Benign tumors should be reported when either statistically or biologically significant increases over controls are observed.

		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-21">
			<p>Toxic effects observed during the conduct of repeated dose toxicity studies should be considered for TSCA §8(e) reporting. These effects include frank toxicity that is readily observable as well as adverse effects seen only as the result of gross and/or histopathological examination. Liver or kidney weight changes alone that are less than 10% of total body weight, except in developmental toxicity studies, are rarely in practice considered by EPA to be of biological significance and therefore would not be reportable under TSCA §8(e). Other organ weight changes should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. As with acute toxicity studies, the degree of toxicity is important. The more serious (or significant) the observed effect, the less emphasis should be given to actual or potential exposure for TSCA §8(e) reporting, i.e., the most serious human health effects are reportable without considering exposure, which is presumed.</p>

		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-23">
			<p>Criteria used to determine TSCA §8(e) reporting in the case of acute toxicity findings in animals depends on the nature of the effects observed and the dose at which the effects occurred. For example, data showing a tested chemical to be extremely toxic (e.g., lethality at very low doses) by inhalation, dermal or oral administration should be reported. On the other hand, the need to report data indicating that a chemical has a moderate degree of acute toxicity depends on the degree of actual or potential exposure to the tested chemical. Information showing a chemical to be slightly or minimally toxic on an acute basis is not typically considered to be reportable.

Although many routine tests are based on a knowledge of toxicity associated with a chemical, previously unknown effects can occur during such tests and may be reportable if the information meets the criteria described in Part V. of the 2003 Reporting Guidance. The most serious human health effects include any pattern of effects or evidence that reasonably supports the conclusion that the chemical substance or mixture can produce cancer, mutation, birth defects or toxic effects resulting in death, or serious or prolonged incapacitation, including the loss of a normal bodily function resulting in relatively serious impairment of normal activities. For these effects, exposure is presumed. For other human health effects, the level of exposure or potential exposure should be used to determine TSCA §8(e) reportability.

		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-28">
			<p>"Widespread distribution" means extensive. Persons with a possible TSCA §8(e) reporting obligation should consider amount, extent and patterns of contamination in determining if distribution is extensive enough to be considered widespread. For example, a chemical spill involving thousands of pounds of a toxic chemical should be reported to EPA under TSCA §8(e) if it migrates to groundwater where there is a reasonable possibility of exposure to humans or environmental species through drinking water or agriculture. But a smaller chemical release that was cleaned up and contained before any substantial distribution to the environment occurred may not be TSCA §8(e) reportable. "Previously unsuspected" is not only unknown, but considered unlikely based on previously available information. "Environmental media" are soil, sediment, surface and ground water, air (including workplace and other indoor air) and, by extension, commercial products containing toxic chemical contaminant(s).</p>

			<p>Regulations, orders and permits with threshold triggers for reporting are among the benchmark levels that EPA instructs persons to consider. When data are required to be collected but reporting is not triggered by the levels found because they are below regulatory threshold levels, then there is a presumption that reporting such information under TSCA §8(e) is not warranted. However, there may be circumstances where additional data indicate otherwise (e.g., unexpected persistence, bioaccumulation, widespread contamination or toxicity information not considered in setting a permit or an order that would be likely to lower the reporting level under that permit).

			<p>Yes. Although the presence of toxic chemicals in environmental media may be well known, one of the purposes of TSCA §8(e) reporting is to identify previously unsuspected environmental contamination at different sites.

However, to the extent that the discovery of environmental contamination would be reported fully and in a timely manner to Federal or state authorities under various programs such as the Underground Storage Tank (UST) and Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) programs, and various local and state site remediation programs, TSCA §8(e) reporting would not be required.</p>

For example, reporting of non-emergency situations of environmental contamination may be warranted where modeling results reliably support available information that the contamination involves widespread and previously unsuspected distribution in the environment of a chemical known to cause serious adverse effects to humans or non-human organisms at projected exposure levels.</p>

		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-38">
			<p>In cases where the risk assessment relies on actual data showing that widespread and previously unsuspected environmental distribution and exposure to a chemical known to cause serious adverse effects has occurred or is substantially likely to occur, submission of the exposure data underlying the assessment should be considered for TSCA §8(e) reporting. However, to the extent that Proposition 65 triggers are based on conservative safety factors and exposure scenarios, the applicability of such requirements may not necessarily coincide with TSCA §8(e) reporting criteria. If exposure data underlying the assessment are reported, the assessment itself may be submitted as supplementary information, but its submission is not required.</p>

		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-39">
			<p>Typically no. Such assessments are often conducted in situations where potential exposure to the chemical has already been identified. For example, contamination of workplace air or surfaces by substances known to the manufacturer and EPA, such as Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulated substances, would not need to be examined for §8(e) reporting under Part V. (b)(1) of the TSCA Section 8(e) Reporting Guidance because they are not "previously unsuspected." However, information should be considered for reporting if it reasonably supports a conclusion of substantial risk (combination of toxicity and exposure) that was previously unknown. In order for workplace situation to be reportable under TSCA §8(e), it would need to be previously unsuspected and involve serious toxic effects. Also, a sudden release of a large quantity of an OSHA regulated substance may need to be considered for TSCA §8(e) reporting as an emergency incident of contamination, depending on the quantity and toxic properties of the substance.</p>

<h3><a id="cbi" name="cbi"></a>CBI Claims</h3>

<ul class="accordion"><li><a class="accordion-title" href="toxic-substances-control-act-section-8e-frequent.html#pane-42" title="Click to expand description">Q.42. How will EPA treat a confidential business information (CBI) claim for a chemical name and other chemical identity information associated with a health and safety study submitted under TSCA §8(e) where the chemical name is listed on the non-confidential portion of the TSCA Chemical Substance Inventory at the time of the TSCA §8(e) submission? </a>

		<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-42">
			<p>EPA intends to review §8(e) submissions for confidential business information (CBI) claims regarding chemical identities that are publicly available on the TSCA Chemical Substance Inventory. EPA expects to find that a chemical name or CAS Registry Number associated with a health and safety study in a §8(e) filing, where the substance is already listed on the public portion of the Inventory, clearly is not entitled to confidential treatment. Where the Agency determines information clearly is not entitled to confidential treatment, any confidentiality claims for that information will be addressed in a manner consistent with provisions at <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2010-title40-vol1/pdf/CFR-2010-title40-vol1-sec2-204.pdf">40 CFR § 2.204(d)(2).</a></p>

			<p>As a general rule, TSCA §14(b)(2) provides that health and safety studies and information from health and safety studies are not entitled to confidential treatment, with an exception for information that “discloses processes used in the manufacturing or processing of a chemical substance or mixture,” or, in the case of a mixture, where release of the data discloses the portion of a mixture comprised by a particular substance. Chemical identity is part of a health and safety study. As such, chemical identity associated with a health and safety study submitted under §8(e) is not entitled to confidential treatment unless it falls into one of the exemptions under TSCA §14(b)(2). Where the identity of a chemical substance is already contained on the public portion of the TSCA Chemical Substance Inventory, the identity itself, as well as any information that might conceivably be derived from it about processes or portions, has already been disclosed.</p>

			<p>EPA recognizes that companies may at times desire to protect the relationship between the substance and the submitting company. Some companies in this situation may believe they have a basis to claim the company name as confidential rather than the chemical identity. In those instances where a company’s name or other company identifier would not be considered health and safety data, and where that information would qualify for protection under Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act, the company identity may be eligible for confidential treatment. Nonetheless, EPA requests confidentiality claims be made sparingly because of the importance of public availability of such data. EPA may review incoming claims and determine whether or not the information is entitled to confidential treatment.</p>

			<p>This confirms EPA’s long held position that, when a health and safety study is submitted to EPA, chemical identity is part of, or underlying data to, the health and safety study. Therefore, the chemical identity itself would be covered by the term ‘‘health and safety study’’ as defined in §3(6) of TSCA and as used in the disclosure provisions contained in TSCA §14.</p>
