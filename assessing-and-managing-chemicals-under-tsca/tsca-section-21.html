<p><strong>Anthropogenic Emissions of Carbon Dioxide</strong><br /><br />
	On June 30, 2015, EPA received a <a href="tsca-section-21-petition-requesting-epa-regulate.html">petition</a> under Section 21 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) from the Center for Biological Diversity and Donn J. Viviani, Ph.D., requesting EPA to promulgate regulations under section 6 of TSCA to protect “public health and the environment from the serious harms associated with anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide, including ocean acidification.” The petition alternately requests that EPA “adopt a rule under section 4 of [TSCA] requiring manufacturers and processors responsible for the generation of carbon dioxide to undertake testing to determine toxicity, persistence, and other characteristics which affect health and the environment and are necessary to determine if there is an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment.” EPA will issue its response to the petition on or before September 27, 2015. <a href="epa-letter-acknowledging-receipt-section-21-petition.html">Read EPA’s letter acknowledging receipt of the petition</a>.

<p><strong>Biodiesel Partial Exemption from Chemical Data Reporting (CDR)</strong><br /><br />
	March 30, 2015 - EPA published a <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=EPA-HQ-OPPT-2014-0809-0015">Federal Register Notice withdrawing the direct final rule</a> that added six chemical substances to the list of chemical substances that are partially exempt from reporting processing and use information under the Chemical Data Reporting (CDR) rule, at 40 CFR 711.6(b)(2)(iv). On February 26, 2015, EPA received an adverse comment pertaining to the addition of the six chemical substances to the list; therefore, in accordance with the procedures specified in the direct final rule, EPA withdrew the rule. EPA intends to publish a notice proposing to add these six chemical substances to the list of chemical substances that are partially exempt from reporting processing and use information under the CDR rule.</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong> On October 21, 2014, EPA received a <a href="tsca-section-21-petition-section-8a-partial-exemption.html">petition</a> under Section 21 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) from the Biobased Renewable Products Advocacy Group requesting that EPA initiate a rulemaking to amend the TSCA Section 8 Chemical Data Reporting (CDR) partially exempted chemical list at 40 CFR Section 711.6(b)(1) to add “biodiesel” as a chemical category for partial exemption from CDR processing- and use-reporting by adding six chemicals to the list. The petitioner also filed a separate petition, under 40 CFR 711.6(b)(2)(iii)(A), requesting that the same six chemical substances be listed at 40 CFR 711.6(b)(2)(iv), indicating that EPA has determined that information on processing and use is of “low current interest.”</p>

<p>On January 16, 2015, EPA granted the petition to list the chemicals under 40 CFR 711.6(b)(2)(iv) and denied the Section 21 petition by letter. EPA determined that, based on the totality of information on the chemical substances, the Agency has low current interest in the CDR processing and use information for these six chemicals and published a direct final rule to amend the list of chemicals at 40 CFR 711.6(b)(2)(iv) to include the six chemicals included in the petition. Because an additional decision to place these six chemical substances on the list at 40 CFR 711.6(b)(1), either individually or as a “biodiesel” category, would afford no further relief to the petitioner, EPA denied the Section 21 petition as moot.

<p><strong>Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC)</strong><br /><br />
	August 21, 2014 – On July 29, 2014, EPA received a <a href="tsca-section-21-petition-promulgate-regulations.html">petition</a> under Section 21 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) and section 7004(a) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) from the Center for Biological Diversity tasking EPA to promulgate regulations governing the safe treatment, storage and disposal of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), vinyl chloride and associated dialkyl- and alkylarylesters of 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid, commonly known as phthalate plasticizers. On October 31, EPA denied the TSCA Section 21 portion of the petition by letter. After careful consideration, EPA denied the petitioner's request to initiate a TSCA section 6 rulemaking, because the TSCA section 21 petition does not specify what risk management action it is requesting; set forth sufficient facts to establish that the disposal of PVC, vinyl chloride, or phthalates used as plasticizers presents or will present an unreasonable risk; or explain why action under TSCA would be preferable to action under other statutory authorities. EPA also denied the petitioner's request to initiate a TSCA section 4 rulemaking to require further toxicity testing of PVC, vinyl chloride, or phthalates used as plasticizers, because the TSCA section 21 petition does not set forth sufficient facts for EPA to find that the toxicity information available to the Agency is insufficient to permit a reasoned evaluation of the health or environmental effects of these PVC constituents, or for EPA to conclude that toxicity testing is necessary to develop any missing data. The TSCA Section 21 petition was accompanied by an independent petition for EPA to take action under the authority of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). EPA continues to review the petitioner's requests for action under RCRA; it is under review by the Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery, which is responsible for programs under RCRA. <a href="tsca-section-21-petition-promulgate-regulations.html"> Read EPA’s letter acknowledging the request of the petitioner</a><a href="../oppt/chemtest/pubs/Acknowledgement_Letter_to_CBD_Section_21_08212014.pdf.html">,</a> <a href="tsca-section-21-petition-promulgate-regulations.html">EPA’s response</a>, and the <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=EPA-HQ-OPPT-2014-0684-0001">Federal Register Notice</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Lead in Paint - Public and Commercial Buildings</strong><br /><br />
	March 12, 2014 -- On October 31, 2013, EPA received a <a href="tsca-section-21-petition-concerning-lead-paint-public.html">petition</a> under Section 21 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), from the National Center for Healthy Housing, the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades, the Lead and Environmental Hazards Association, and the National Association of Lead and Healthy Homes Grantees, requesting that EPA promulgate a rule pursuant to TSCA Section 8(d) requiring property managers, building owners, and contractors disturbing paint on public and commercial buildings to submit to EPA certain records related to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s construction standard for lead. On January 28, 2014, EPA denied the TSCA Section 21 petition by letter. After careful consideration, EPA found that the petition did not demonstrate that a TSCA Section 8(d) reporting rule is necessary and that, while the records requested by the petitioners are potentially useful, they are not necessary to carry out the purposes of TSCA or to support the rulemaking analysis.

<p><strong>Hydrofluorosilicic acid (HFSA) as a Water Fluoridation Agent</strong><br /><br />
	August 6, 2013 -- On May 9, 2013, EPA received a petition from J. William Hirzy, Ph.D., Chemist in Residence, with American University, requesting that EPA take action under section 6 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to prohibit the use of hydrofluorosilicic acid (HFSA) as a water fluoridation agent. Read the <a href="tsca-section-21-petition-prohibit-use-hydrofluorosilicic.html">petition</a> and EPA’s <a href="tsca-section-21-petition-prohibit-use-hydrofluorosilicic.html">acknowledgement letter</a>. On August 6, 2013, EPA notified the petitioners that after careful consideration, the Agency denied the TSCA section 21 petition because the evidence presented by the petitioners does not adequately support a conclusion that HFSA, when used as a fluoridation agent, presents or will present an unreasonable risk to health or the environment and that a TSCA section 6 rulemaking is necessary to protect adequately against such risk.

<p><strong>PCBs - Navy SINKEX</strong><br /><br />
	July 12, 2012 -- On April 11, 2012, EPA received a <a href="tsca-section-21-petition-requesting-epa-take-action.html">request from the Basel Action Network, the Sierra Club, and the Center for Biological Diversity</a> asking that EPA take certain actions to protect human health and the marine environment from PCBs that leach from ships sunk through the U.S. Navy's sinking exercises (SINKEX) program. The petitioners requested that EPA amend the existing general permit issued to the Navy under the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA) or, in the alternative, enact rules under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). In requesting actions under TSCA, the petitioners have invoked the citizen petition provisions of section 21 of TSCA. In a letter dated July 10, 2012, EPA denied the request for actions under TSCA because the petitioners did not demonstrate that the TSCA rules they requested are necessary. Among other things, EPA determined that TSCA is not the appropriate vehicle for the regulation of PCBs on ships used in Navy’s SINKEX program, because the Administrator in 1999 determined under section 9(b) of TSCA that such regulation should be under the MPRSA, not TSCA. See the Agency’s <a href="tsca-section-21-petition-requesting-epa-take-action.html">response to the requests for action under TSCA</a> and the <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/#%21docketDetail;D=EPA-HQ-OPPT-2012-0495">Federal Register Notice</a>. EPA will respond separately to the petitioners’ request for revisions to the general permit for the transport of target vessels under SINKEX issued by EPA under the MPRSA.</p>

<p><strong>Lead in Shot and Bullets</strong><br /><br />
	April 9, 2012 -- On March 13, 2012, EPA received a <a href="tsca-section-21-petition-requesting-epa-regulate-lead.html">petition</a> from the Center for Biological Diversity and a number of other groups requesting that EPA take action to regulate bullets and shot containing lead for use in hunting and shooting sports. In August 2010, EPA denied a similar <a href="tsca-section-21-petition-requesting-epa-regulate-lead.html">request</a> on lead bullets and shot after concluding that the Agency does not have the legal authority to regulate this type of product under TSCA. On April 9, 2012 EPA notified the petitioners that the March 2012 submission provides no new information that would lead EPA to consider the 2012 submission to be a new petition under Section 21, nor does it include information not previously considered by EPA that would warrant reconsideration of EPA’s conclusion that it does not have authority under TSCA to regulate shot and bullets.

<p><strong>Lead in Fishing Tackle</strong><br /><br />
	February 14, 2012 -- On November 17, 2011, EPA received a <a href="tsca-section-21-petition-requesting-epa-regulate-lead-0.html">petition</a> under Section 21 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), from the Center for Biological Diversity, the Loon Lake Loon Association, and Project Gutpile, requesting that EPA “evaluate the unreasonable risk of injury to the environment from fishing tackle containing lead (including fishing weights, sinkers, lures, jigs, and/or other tackle) of various sizes and uses that are ingested by wildlife, resulting in lead exposure.” The petition also requests that EPA “initiate a proceeding for the issuance of a rulemaking under Section 6 of TSCA to adequately protect against such risks.” <a href="tsca-section-21-petition-requesting-epa-regulate-lead-0.html">Read EPA's letter acknowledging receipt of the petition</a>. On February 14, 2012, EPA notified the petitioners that Agency denied the petition. After careful consideration, EPA found that the petition did not demonstrate federal action is necessary, based in part on the fact that in many of the places where lead exposure among birds may be a problem, states have taken action to regulate the use of fishing tackle containing lead or initiated programs to reduce its use. See the <a href="tsca-section-21-petition-requesting-epa-regulate-lead-0.html">Agency’s response</a> and the <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/#%21documentDetail;D=EPA-HQ-OPPT-2012-0135-0001"> Federal Register Notice</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Cadmium in Consumer Products, Especially Toy Metal Jewelry</strong></p>

<p>January 3, 2013 -- <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/#%21documentDetail;D=EPA-HQ-OPPT-2011-0363-0020">A notice withdrawing the immediate final health and safety data reporting rule</a> was published in the Federal Register on December 28, 2012.</p>

<p>On December 14, 2012, EPA informed the regulated community that the Agency is withdrawing the immediate final health and safety data reporting rule for cadmium due to questions and concerns raised about the scope and extent of the rule that indicate that there is significant confusion and uncertainty within certain industrial sectors concerning the rule. EPA will be considering the questions and concerns raised in response to the immediate final and next steps with regard to this rule. EPA will also continue to work with the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to reduce exposure to cadmium in consumer products generally, and especially those consumer products used by or around children, such as children's metal jewelry.</p>

<p>Prior to this, on December 3, 2012, EPA issued an immediate final rule requiring manufacturers and importers of cadmium or cadmium compounds that have been, or are reasonably likely to be, incorporated into consumer products to report unpublished health and safety data to the Agency. <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/#%21documentDetail;D=EPA-HQ-OPPT-2011-0363-0001">Read the rule</a>. The rule was in response to a citizens' petition received in August 2010. On August 30, 2010, EPA granted a <a href="tsca-section-21-petition-requesting-epa-regulate-cadmium.html">petition</a> to use its authority under TSCA section 8(d) to require producers, importers, and processors of cadmium and cadmium compounds that are reasonably likely to be incorporated into consumer products to provide EPA with lists and/or copies of ongoing and completed unpublished health and safety studies relevant to a Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) determination on whether a potential hazard exists and whether a product may be a banned hazardous substance. Petitioners are the Empire State Consumer Project, the Sierra Club, the Center for Environmental Health, and Rochesterians Against the Misuse of Pesticides. They also requested that, working with the CPSC, EPA use its authority under TSCA section 6 to adopt a rule setting limits on cadmium and cadmium compounds in toy metal jewelry.

<p><strong>Natural Rubber in Tires</strong><br /><br />
	On November 19, 2009, EPA received a citizen’s petition that asked it to “establish regulations prohibiting the use and distribution in commerce of <em>Hevea brasiliensis</em> baled natural-rubber for the manufacture of tires. The petition said rubber fails to satisfy The American Society for Testing Materials method ASTM D1076-06 (Category 5),” because: "Implementation of an EPA regulation that guides tire manufacturers to use <em>Hevea brasiliensis</em> baled natural-rubber that satisfies ASTM D1076-06 (Category 5) may affect the incidence of <em>Hevea brasiliensis</em> natural-rubber allergies and allergy induced autism." <a href="tsca-section-21-petition-requesting-epa-establish.html">Read the petition</a>. EPA denied the petitioner’s request on February 16, 2010, as described in a <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/#%21documentDetail;D=EPA-HQ-OPPT-2010-0015-0001">Federal Register notice</a> published on February 22, 2010, (75 FR 7586), for a variety of reasons, including that ASTM D1076-06 (Category 5) did not exist, that it had not been established that natural rubber antigens caused autism, that other federal agencies had evaluated the health risks from <em>Hevea</em> natural rubber latex without prohibiting its use, and that the requirements for a issuing a regulation had not been met. <a href="tsca-section-21-petition-requesting-epa-establish.html">Read EPA’s response</a>.</p>

	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Modify the definition of lead-based paint in 40 CFR 745.103 and 745.223 for previously applied paint or other surface coatings in housing, child-occupied facilities, public building and commercial buildings to reduce the lead levels from 0.5 percent by weight (5,000 parts per million (ppm)) to 0.06 percent by weight (600 ppm) with a corresponding reduction in the 1.0 milligram per square centimeter standard.</p>
