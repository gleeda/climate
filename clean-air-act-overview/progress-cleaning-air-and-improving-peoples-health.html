<p><a name="pollution" id="pollution"></a></p>

<h3>For more than forty-five years the Clean Air Act has cut pollution as the U.S. economy has grown.</h3>

<ul><li>
		<div>Experience with the Clean Air Act since 1970 has shown that protecting public health and building the economy can go hand in hand.</div>
	</li>
	<li>
		<div>Clean Air Act programs have lowered levels of six common pollutants -- particles, ozone, lead, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide -- as well as numerous toxic pollutants.</div>
	</li>
	<li>
		<div>From 1970 to 2015, aggregate national emissions of the six common pollutants alone dropped an average of 70 percent while gross domestic product grew by 246 percent. This progress reflects efforts by state, local and tribal governments; EPA; private sector companies; environmental groups and others.</div>
	</li>
	<li>
		<div>The emissions reductions have led to dramatic improvements in the quality of the air that we breathe. Between 1990 and 2015, national concentrations of air pollutants improved 85 percent for lead, 84 percent for carbon monoxide, 67 percent for sulfur dioxide (1-hour), 60 percent for nitrogen dioxide (annual), and 3 percent for ozone. Fine particle concentrations (24-hour) improved 37 percent and coarse particle concentrations (24-hour) improved 69 percent between 2000, when trends data begins for fine particles, and 2015. (For more trends information, see EPA's <a href="../airtrends/lead.html">Air Trends</a> site.)</div>
	</li>
	<li>
		<div>These air quality improvements have enabled many areas of the country to meet national air quality standards set to protect public health and the environment. For example, all of the 41 areas that had unhealthy levels of carbon monoxide in 1991 now have levels that meet the health-based national air quality standard. A key reason is that the motor vehicle fleet is much cleaner because of Clean Air Act emissions standards for new motor vehicles.</div>
	</li>
	<li>
		<div>Airborne lead pollution, a widespread health concern before EPA phased out lead in motor vehicle gasoline under Clean Air Act authority, now meets national air quality standards in most areas of the country.</div>
	</li>
	<li>
		<div>State emission control measures to implement the Act, as well as EPA's national emissions standards, have contributed to air quality improvements.</div>
	</li>

<h3>Because of the Act, Americans breathe less pollution and face lower risks of premature death and other serious health effects.</h3>

<p>A <a href="benefits-and-costs-clean-air-act-1990-2020-second-prospective-study.html">peer-reviewed EPA study</a> issued in March 2011 found that the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 are achieving large health benefits that will grow further over time as programs take full effect.</p>

<p>This chart shows the health benefits of Clean Air Act programs that reduce levels of fine particles and ozone.</p>

A peer-reviewed <a href="benefits-and-costs-clean-air-act-1970-1990-study-design-and-summary-results.html">1997 EPA Report to Congress</a> reviewed the benefits of the Act from 1970 to 1990, and concluded that in 1990 alone, pollution reductions under the Act prevented 205,000 early deaths, 10.4 million lost I.Q. points in children due to lead exposure, and millions of other cases of health effects.</li>
	<li>Independent scientific research shows that reductions in air pollution are associated with widespread public health benefits. For example, one study found that reductions in fine particle pollution between 1980 and 2000 in U.S. cities led to improvements in average life expectancy at birth of approximately seven months.<a name="endref1" id="endref1" href="../node/87943.html#edn1"><sup>1 </sup></a></li>

<h3>Environmental damage from air pollution is reduced.</h3>

<ul><li>
		<div>Lower air pollution levels mean less damage to the health of ecosystems.</div>
	</li>
	<li>
		<div>Environmental effects of air pollution include damage to plants and long-term forest health, soil nutrient deterioration, accumulation of toxics in the food chain, damage to fish and other aquatic life in lakes and streams, and nitrogen enrichment of coastal estuaries causing oxygen depletion and resulting harm to fish and other aquatic animal populations.</div>
	</li>
	<li>
		<div>Reducing air pollution also improves crop and timber yields, a benefit worth an estimated $5.5 billion to those industries' welfare in 2010, according to the peer-reviewed <a href="benefits-and-costs-clean-air-act-1990-2020-second-prospective-study.html">March 2011 EPA study</a>.  Better visibility conditions in 2010 from improved air quality in selected national parks and metropolitan areas had an estimated value of $34 billion.</div>

<h3>The value of Clean Air Act health benefits far exceeds the costs of reducing pollution.</h3>

<ul><li>
		<div><a href="benefits-and-costs-clean-air-act-1990-2020-second-prospective-study.html">EPA’s peer-reviewed 2011 study</a> found that clean air programs established by the 1990 CAA amendments are expected to yield direct benefits to the American people which vastly exceed compliance costs.</div>
	</li>
	<li>
		<div>The study's central benefits estimate of $2 trillion in 2020 exceeds costs by a factor of more than 30-to-1, and the high benefits estimate exceeds costs by 90 times. Even the low benefits estimate exceeds costs by about 3-to-1.</div>
	</li>
	<li>
		<div>In addition to direct benefits vastly exceeding direct costs, economy-wide modeling conducted for the study found that the economic welfare of American households is better with post-1990 clean air programs than without them. </div>
	</li>
	<li>
		<div>Economic welfare and economic growth rates are improved because cleaner air means fewer air-pollution-related illnesses, which in turn means less money spent on medical treatments and lower absenteeism among American workers. The study projects that the beneficial economic effects of these two improvements alone more than offset the expenditures for pollution control.</div>
	</li>
	<li>
		<div>The EPA report received extensive review and input from the Council on Clean Air Compliance Analysis, an independent panel of distinguished economists, scientists and public health experts established by Congress in 1991.</div>

<h3>New cars, trucks, and nonroad engines use state-of-the-art emission control technologies.</h3>

<p>EPA has required dramatic reductions in emissions from <a href="../node/157173.html">new motor vehicles</a> and <a href="https://www.epa.gov/emission-standards-reference-guide/epa-emission-standards-nonroad-engines-and-vehicles">non-road engines</a> - such as those used in construction, agriculture, industry, trains and marine vessels -- through standards that require a combination of cleaner engine technologies and cleaner fuels.

<h3>New power plants and factories use modern pollution control technology.</h3>

<ul><li>The Act requires that when new industrial facilities are designed and built, good pollution control must be part of the design. This means that as new, cleaner facilities are built, the country's industrial base becomes cleaner overall. Public health is protected as economic growth proceeds. <em><a href="../stationary-sources-air-pollution.html">&lt;Learn more about stationary sources of air pollution.&gt;</a></em>

		<ul><li>In areas not meeting air quality standards, to avoid making pollution worse, new and modified large plants and factories must meet the lowest achievable emission rate and obtain offsetting emissions reductions from other sources.</li>
			<li>In areas that meet air quality standards, new and modified large plants and factories must apply the best available technology considering cost and avoid causing significant degradation of air quality or visibility impairment in national parks.</li>
			<li>For example, new coal-fired power plants typically install control devices that capture up to 98 percent of the sulfur dioxide and in many cases 90 percent of the nitrogen oxide emissions, relative to uncontrolled levels.</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>These requirements are applied through pre-construction permitting programs that are administered by state, local, tribal, or EPA permitting authorities, depending on the location.</li>

<ul><li>A national system of marketable pollution allowances has dramatically cut power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide, reducing acid rain as well as secondary formation of fine particle pollution that contributes to premature death. <a href="../node/128115.html">Acid rain</a>, which includes wet and dry deposition of acidic compounds from the atmosphere, results from emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.</li>
	<li>Reducing acid rain has significantly reduced damage to water quality in lakes and streams, and improved the health of ecosystems and forests.
		<ul><li>Between the 1989 to 1991 and 2009 to 2011 observation periods, wet deposition of sulfate (which causes acidification) decreased by more than 55 percent on average across the eastern United States.</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>The dramatic emissions reductions achieved by the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/airmarkets/acid-rain-program">acid rain program </a>have helped to reduce atmospheric levels of fine particle pollution, avoiding numerous premature deaths.</li>
	<li>Government and independent analyses have concluded that the benefits of the program far outweigh the costs, as detailed in the U.S. government's National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program (NAPAP) <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/2011_napap_508.pdf">2011 Report to Congress (PDF)</a>. <span class="fileinfo">(132 pp, 14.5 MB, <a href="../epahome/pdf.html">About PDF</a>)</span></li>
	<li>Multiple analyses show that the cost of the fully implemented program is a fraction of the originally estimated cost - between $1-2 billion annually rather than the $6 billion EPA originally estimated in 1990, according to the NAPAP report.</li>

<h3>Interstate air pollution has been reduced.</h3>

<p>Further reductions in power plant pollution have been achieved by state and EPA efforts to cut interstate air pollution, achieving additional public health benefits and helping downwind states meet health-based air quality standards for fine particles and ozone.</p>

<ul><li>Twelve New England and mid-Atlantic states and the District of Columbia -- the Ozone Transport Region created by the 1990 Amendments -- worked together to create a nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) Budget Program and to adopt other controls that help improve ozone levels throughout the region.</li>
	<li>Building on that success, EPA issued a broader <a href="https://www.epa.gov/airmarkets/nox-budget-trading-program">“NOx SIP Call”</a> Rule creating a similar NOx Budget Trading Program for much of the eastern United States, which ran from 2003 to 2008. As of 2008, the program cut summertime NOx emissions from power plants by 62 percent from 2000 levels. These reductions, along with the NOx reductions from federal motor vehicle standards, are responsible for substantial improvement in ozone levels across the eastern United States.</li>
	<li>The subsequent Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) has achieved large reductions in power plant annual SO2 and NOx emissions that contribute to fine particles, as well as some additional summertime NOx reductions beyond those required by the NOx SIP Call.
		<ul><li>CAIR, which had initial compliance deadlines in 2009 and 2010, is a major reason that almost all areas in the East have met the 1997 and 2006 air quality standards for fine particles. In the 2005 CAIR Regulatory Impact Analysis, EPA estimated that the reductions from the CAIR requirements would avoid 13,000 premature deaths a year in 2010.</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>CAIR was replaced by the <a href="../node/133405.html">Cross-State Air Pollution Rule</a>, as of January 1, 2015 to address the 1997 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).</li>
	<li>On September 7, 2016, the EPA revised the CSAPR by finalizing an update for the 2008 ozone NAAQS, known as the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/airmarkets/final-cross-state-air-pollution-rule-update">CSAPR Update</a>. CSAPR Update will further reduce summertime NO<sub>X</sub> emissions from power plants in the eastern U.S. and help downwind states to meet the new ozone standards.</li>

					<li>The value of the quantified air quality improvements from MATS for people's health alone totals $37 billion to $90 billion each year. That means that for every dollar spent to reduce this pollution, Americans get $3-9 in health benefits. These significant health benefits do not include the benefits associated with reducing air toxics emitted from power plants because EPA does not at this time have the ability to quantify such benefits. Thus, the Agency is likely underestimating the benefits of the rule.</li>
					<li>The benefits of MATS are widely distributed and are especially important to minority and low income populations who are disproportionately impacted by asthma and other debilitating health conditions.</li>

	<li>The United States is one of 197 countries that are parties to the <a href="../ozone-layer-science/montreal-protocol-actions-protect-ozone-layer.html">Montreal Protocol</a>, an international treaty to protect the ozone layer.

	<li>Consistent with the Montreal Protocol, the Clean Air Act requires that EPA develop and implement regulations for the responsible management of ozone-depleting substances in the United States to help restore the ozone layer.

<h3>EPA has taken initial steps under the Act to limit emissions that cause climate change and ocean acidification.</h3>

<ul><li>Consistent with a <a href="../climatechange/legal-basis-greenhouse-gas-endangerment-finding.html">2007 Supreme Court decision</a>, EPA in 2009 completed a <a href="../climatechange/endangerment-and-cause-or-contribute-findings-greenhouse-gases-under-clean-air-act-5.html">scientific determination</a> that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are reasonably anticipated to endanger the public health and welfare of current and future generations and that emissions of greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles contributes to this air pollution.</li>
	<li>EPA's first steps to reduce harmful greenhouse gas pollution focused on motor vehicles. Transportation sources in 2010 were responsible for more than a quarter of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.<a name="endref7" id="endref7" href="../node/87943.html#edn7"><sup>7</sup></a>
		<ul><li>EPA and the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration worked together to set <a href="https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPDF.cgi/P100AKHW.PDF?Dockey=P100AKHW.PDF">greenhouse gas and fuel economy standards</a> for passenger vehicles in model years 2012-2016 and 2017-2025.</li>
			<li>Over the life of these vehicles, the standards will save an estimated $1.7 trillion for consumers and businesses and cut America's oil consumption by 12 billion barrels, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 6 billion metric tons.</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>EPA's and NHTSA's <a href="https://www.epa.gov/emission-standards-reference-guide/epa-emission-standards-heavy-duty-highway-engines-and-vehicles">standards for heavy-duty trucks and buses</a>, which were issued in August 2011, present large similar benefits. The final phase two program, finalized in August of 2016, promotes a new generation of cleaner, more fuel-efficient trucks by encouraging the wider application of currently available technologies and the development of new and advanced cost-effective technologies through model year 2027.</li>
	<li>In January 2011, states and EPA initiated Clean Air Act <a href="../node/110417.html">permitting of greenhouse gas pollution</a> from the largest new and modified stationary sources. In the first year of permitting, dozens of large sources such as power plants, cement plants, refineries and steel mills received pre-construction permits for greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
	<li>On August 3, 2015, President Obama and the EPA unveiled the <a href="../node/40801.html">Clean Power Plan</a> -- a historic and important step in reducing carbon pollution from power plants. On February 9, 2016, the Supreme Court stayed implementation of the Clean Power Plan pending judicial review. The Court’s decision was not on the merits of the rule. EPA firmly believes the Clean Power Plan will be upheld when the merits are considered because the rule rests on strong scientific and legal foundations.</li>
	<li>On May 12, 2016 EPA issued three final rules that together will curb emissions of methane, smog-forming volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and toxic air pollutants such as benzene from new, reconstructed and modified oil and gas sources.</li>
	<li>
		<p>On October 15, 2016, with the United States’ leadership, 197 countries adopted an <a href="../ozone-layer-protection/recent-international-developments-under-montreal-protocol.html">amendment to phase down HFCs under the Montreal Protocol </a>in Kigali, Rwanda. HFCs are greenhouse gases which can have warming impacts hundreds to thousands of times more potent than carbon dioxide. Under the amendment, countries committed to cut the production and consumption of HFCs by more than 80 percent over the next 30 years.</p>

			<li>Chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC)-free air conditioners, refrigerators, aerosol sprays and cleaning solvents</li>
			<li>Water and powder-based coatings to replace petroleum-based formulations</li>
			<li>Vehicles far cleaner than believed possible in the late 1980s due to improvements in evaporative controls, catalyst design and fuel control systems for light-duty vehicles; and treatment devices and retrofit technologies for heavy-duty engines</li>
			<li>Idle-reduction technologies for engines, including truck stop electrification efforts</li>
			<li>Market penetration of gas-electric hybrid vehicles, and clean fuels</li>
