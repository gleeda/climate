		<ul class="accordion"><li><a class="accordion-title" href="determining-chemical-substances-subject-cdr-rule.html#pane-1" title="Click to expand description">8.1. For what chemical substances must CDR information be submitted?</a>

				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-1">
					<p>In general, chemical substances that are listed on the TSCA Inventory and manufactured (including imported) may be subject to CDR. Carefully review the regulations located at 40 CFR 711.5 to determine your reporting requirements. You should consider the following three steps to determine whether you are required to report for each chemical substance that you domestically manufactured (including import) into the United States since the last principal reporting year:</p>

					<ul><li>Step I:  Is your chemical substance subject to the CDR rule?</li>
						<li>Step II:  Are you a manufacturer (including importer) who is required to report?</li>
						<li>Step III: What information must you report?</li>
					</ul><p>See the <a href="../node/141753.html">Instructions for Reporting</a> for help with each of these steps.</p>

					<p>Chemical substances that are the subject of certain TSCA actions have different reporting requirements. Please see the <a href="../node/78971.html">Chemical Substances which are the Subject of Certain TSCA Actions</a> fact sheet for additional information about these specific reporting requirements.</p>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li><a class="accordion-title" href="determining-chemical-substances-subject-cdr-rule.html#pane-2" title="Click to expand description">8.2. Are all substances on the TSCA Inventory subject to the CDR requirements?</a>
				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-2">
					<p>No, some substances are fully exempt or partially exempt from the CDR regulation. See 40 CFR 711.6, 711.9, and 711.10 for information about certain exemptions. The chemical substances that are partially exempt from reporting requirements under CDR are listed in 40 CFR 711.6(b)(1) and 711.6(b)(2). The most recent additions to partially exempt chemicals list can be found under the Petition Results tab of the <a href="../node/19375.html">How To Report Under Chemical Data Reporting</a> page of the CDR website.</p>

					<p>EPA’s Substance Registry Services (SRS) contains searchable information regarding the reporting status of particular chemical substances.  <a href="../node/138235.html">Please see the CDR instructions on how to search SRS.</a></p>

					<p>In contrast to reporting periods prior to the 2012 CDR, inorganic chemical substances are no longer partially exempt from reporting requirements. Therefore, submitters should report complete information on inorganic chemical substances.</p>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li><a class="accordion-title" href="determining-chemical-substances-subject-cdr-rule.html#pane-3" title="Click to expand description">8.3. Are chemical analyses needed to report CDR information?</a>
				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-3">
					<p>No. The CDR regulation does not require submitters to perform chemical analyses. The information required by EPA is limited to information that is “known to or reasonably ascertainable.” This standard is applicable to all information reported in accordance with 40 CFR 711.15(b).</p>

			</li>
			<li><a class="accordion-title" href="determining-chemical-substances-subject-cdr-rule.html#pane-4" title="Click to expand description">8.4. How does a person access the TSCA Inventory?</a>
				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-4">
					<p>Visit the <a href="../tsca-inventory.html">TSCA Chemical Substance Inventory</a> webpage to access the TSCA Inventory. In addition, the electronic CDR reporting tool, e-CDRweb, has the ability to access the TSCA Inventory using EPA’s <a href="https://iaspub.epa.gov/sor_internet/registry/substreg/home/overview/home.do">Substance Registry Services (SRS)</a>. The public Inventory does not contain the chemical name and CAS number of chemical substances for which specific identities have been claimed as TSCA confidential business information; only generic chemical names and accession numbers are included for these substances.</p>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li><a class="accordion-title" href="determining-chemical-substances-subject-cdr-rule.html#pane-5" title="Click to expand description">8.5. What should a company do if it determines that it manufactures a chemical substance that is not included on the TSCA Inventory?</a>
				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-5">
					<p>In order to manufacture (including import) a chemical substance for a non-exempt commercial purpose, it must be: on the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/tsca-inventory/how-access-tsca-inventory">TSCA Inventory</a>, a naturally occurring chemical substance as defined by TSCA (see 40 CFR 710.4(b)), or excluded by TSCA Section 3(2)(B)*. You can visit <a href="../srs.html">Substance Registry Service</a>s and view its “2016 CDR TSCA Inv” list to determine whether your chemical substance is on the TSCA Inventory for 2016 CDR purposes. </p>

					<p>If your chemical substance is not on the TSCA Inventory, please see EPA’s <a href="https://www.epa.gov/reviewing-new-chemicals-under-toxic-substances-control-act-tsca/basic-information-review-new">Pre-Manufacture Notice (PMN) Requirement</a> flowchart to determining if a Notice must be submitted to the Agency, prior to manufacture (including import). You can also phone the TSCA Hotline at (202)-554-1404 for assistance.</p>

					<p>A chemical substance that is not on the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/tsca-inventory/how-access-tsca-inventory">TSCA Inventory</a>, a naturally occurring chemical substance as defined by TSCA, or exempted in TSCA Section 3(2)(B)) must be submitted with a notice as per 40 CFR 720.22(a)(1), prior to manufacture (including import). </p>

					<p>If a company discovers that it is manufacturing (including importing) a substance which is not on the TSCA Inventory and should have been reported to EPA as a new chemical substance, such manufacture or importation is in violation of Section 5 of TSCA and could subject the company to enforcement action. If a company finds that it has or may have manufactured or imported a chemical substance in violation of TSCA, contact the Agency at the following address: <a href="../compliance/epas-edisclosure.html">https://www.epa.gov/compliance/epas-edisclosure</a>.</p>

					<p><a href="../node/56039.html#_bookmark3">Significant reductions</a> in penalties may be given to persons who voluntarily disclose such information. Note, however, that continued manufacture, (including importation) or use of such chemical substances remains in violation per Section 15 of TSCA, even after a company has contacted EPA, until the requirements of TSCA Section 5 have been met. These reporting requirements are distinct from the CDR.</p>

					<p><small><cite><em>*Substances exempted in TSCA Section 3(2)(B) include: any pesticide as defined by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, when manufactured, processed, or distributed in commerce for use as a pesticide; any food, food additive, drug, cosmetic, or device, as defined by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, when manufactured, processed, or distributed in commerce for use as a food, food additive, drug, cosmetic or device; tobacco or any tobacco product; any source material, special nuclear material, or byproduct material as such terms are defined in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954; and, any article the sale of which is subject to the tax imposed by Section 4181 of the Internal Revenue Code.</em></cite></small></p>

			<li><a class="accordion-title" href="determining-chemical-substances-subject-cdr-rule.html#pane-6" title="Click to expand description">8.6. How do the TSCA Inventory flags relate to CDR and have they been updated for the 2016 CDR submission period?</a>
				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-6">
					<p>Special flags are used throughout the TSCA Inventory to identify those substances on the Inventory that are the subject of an EPA rule or order promulgated under TSCA, as well as to indicate the types of full or partial exemptions from TSCA reporting requirements. The following is a list of flags that are used and would be of interest for CDR:</p>

					<ul><li>E — indicates a substance that is the subject of a Section 5(e) Consent Order under TSCA.</li>
						<li>F — indicates a substance that is the subject of a Section 5(f) Rule under TSCA.</li>
						<li>N — indicates a polymeric substance containing no free-radical initiator in its Inventory name but is considered to cover the designated polymer made with any free-radical initiator regardless of the amount used.</li>
						<li>P — indicates a commenced PMN substance.</li>
						<li>R — indicates a substance that is the subject of a Section 6 risk management rule under TSCA.</li>
						<li>S — indicates a substance that is identified in a proposed or final Significant New Use Rule.</li>
						<li>T — indicates a substance that is the subject of a Section 4 test rule under TSCA.</li>
						<li>XU — indicates a substance exempt from reporting under the CDR Rule, (40 CFR 711).</li>
						<li>Y1 — indicates an exempt polymer that has a number-average molecular weight of 1,000 or greater.</li>
						<li>Y2 — indicates an exempt polymer that is a polyester and is made only from reactants included in a specified list of low concern reactants that comprises one of the eligibility criteria for the exemption rule.</li>
					</ul><p>The “E”, “F”, “R”, “S”, and “T” flags identify those chemical substances that are subject to specific types of TSCA regulatory activities. These flags are useful for CDR, because they identify chemical substances subject to TSCA regulatory activities that make them ineligible for other CDR exemptions and subject to a lower production volume reporting threshold.</p>

					<p>The “XU” flag identifies those chemical substances on the TSCA Inventory that are the subject of full exemptions from CDR requirements. The “Y1” and “Y2” flags identify polymers that were exempted from full PMN reporting under TSCA Section 5 according to the original Polymer Exemption rule of 1984, and most polymers are exempt from CDR.</p>

					<p>These flags are embedded into the Substance Registry Services (SRS) chemical lookup within the current edition of e-CDRweb reporting tool and have been updated to reflect the 2016 reporting requirements. When the chemical lookup function is used, and the selected chemical has been assigned a special flag, the reporting tool will display a notice on the screen indicating the TSCA action or exemption status of the chemical. Please note that you are advised to use the flags only as a guide; you are responsible for verifying whether a chemical substance listed on the TSCA Inventory is exempt from reporting or ineligible for exemption from reporting.</p>

		<ul class="accordion"><li><a class="accordion-title" href="determining-chemical-substances-subject-cdr-rule.html#pane-7" title="Click to expand description">9.1. Are mixtures listed on the TSCA Inventory?</a>
				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-7">
					<p>The TSCA Inventory lists chemical substances, not mixtures. For purposes of the CDR regulation, EPA uses the definition of “mixture” from TSCA Section 3(8): “any combination of two or more chemical substances if the combination does not occur in nature and is not, in whole or in part, the result of a chemical reaction; except that such term does include any combination which occurs, in whole or in part, as a result of a chemical reaction if none of the chemical substances comprising the combination is a new chemical substance and if the combination could have been manufactured for commercial purposes without a chemical reaction at the time the chemical substances comprising the combination were combined.”</p>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li><a class="accordion-title" href="determining-chemical-substances-subject-cdr-rule.html#pane-8" title="Click to expand description">9.2. Are mixtures ever reportable?</a>
				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-8">
					<p>Mixtures are not themselves reported under the CDR, but the individual component chemical substances of a mixture may be reportable. If you manufacture (including import) the substances as part of a mixture, you would evaluate the CDR requirements for each chemical substance in the mixture. For example, for imported mixtures, you need to identify each component chemical substance to determine if the amount of any individual chemical substance in the mixture when combined with the amount(s) of the same chemical substance otherwise manufactured (including imported) at the same site is sufficient to meet or exceed a CDR reporting threshold.</p>

					<p>Note, however, that if you process chemical substances to form a mixture without a chemical reaction by combining domestically manufactured chemical substances you purchase, such that you do not synthesize or produce any of the component chemical substances of the mixture, you are not a manufacturer of those chemical substances and are not required to report those chemical substances under the CDR regulation.</p>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li><a class="accordion-title" href="determining-chemical-substances-subject-cdr-rule.html#pane-9" title="Click to expand description">9.3. How are catalysts reported under CDR?</a>
				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-9">
					<p>The CDR requirements for catalysts follow the same rules as for other chemical substances. Note that some catalytic substances supported on an inert substrate are considered under TSCA to be a mixture of the catalyst and substrate. If you manufacture the catalyst and the substrate and process these chemical substances to form a mixture, you would report your manufacture of the catalyst and the substrate separately.</p>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li><a class="accordion-title" href="determining-chemical-substances-subject-cdr-rule.html#pane-10" title="Click to expand description">9.4. When metal catalysts supported on fixed, inert substrates are regenerated, the catalyst is subjected to high temperatures which convert the metal to its oxide. This is followed by a reduction step which converts the metal oxide back to the base metal. Is this activity subject to CDR requirements?</a>
				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-10">
					<p>The metal catalyst supported on an inert substrate is considered to be a mixture under TSCA. Conversion of the metal catalyst to an oxide and subsequent reduction to the base metal are both manufacturing of different chemical substances for commercial purposes. If the regeneration is all conducted in the same vessel (i.e., the oxide is reduced in the same vessel in which it is made, without storing the oxide or intending to remove it from the vessel for a reason that is not essential to this chemical process), the oxide may satisfy the definition of a non-isolated intermediate for purposes of CDR and be exempt from reporting for that reason. The metal oxide and elemental metal would otherwise both be subject to CDR requirements. Note, however, that only the amounts of the metal oxide and the regenerated base metal must be reported; in many instances, these amounts will be less than the applicable CDR threshold. Because the inert substrate does not undergo a chemical reaction in this scenario, there is no change in the chemical identity of the inert substrate that triggers CDR reporting requirements.</p>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li><a class="accordion-title" href="determining-chemical-substances-subject-cdr-rule.html#pane-11" title="Click to expand description">9.5. How does a company report the importation of a solid solution?</a>
				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-11">
					<p>Solid solutions that are really mixtures of chemical substances should be reported in the same manner in which liquid solutions or other mixtures are reported; i.e., report the amount imported of each chemical substance in the mixture. Please note, however, that mixed (metal) oxides, for which an oxide contains cations of more than one chemical element or cations of a single element in multiple oxidation states, are not considered to be solid solutions for purposes of TSCA reporting. Also intermetallic compounds of well-defined stoichiometry are not considered alloys or solid solutions and are reportable as chemical substances. Although alloys themselves are not reportable as such, the individual metals comprising an alloy must be reported under the CDR.</p>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li><a class="accordion-title" href="determining-chemical-substances-subject-cdr-rule.html#pane-12" title="Click to expand description">9.6. A company manufactures many different compounds containing the metal magnesium, for example MgSO4, MgO, and MgCl2. Is each compound a reportable chemical substance or are they mixtures of magnesium? Should the amount of magnesium in each substance be aggregated and reported as the total amount of magnesium?</a>
				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-12">
					<p>The three magnesium compounds are unique chemical substances each of which has its own distinct CAS Registry Number and entry on the TSCA Inventory. Therefore, the CDR requirements must be evaluated for each of these different compounds and, if necessary, separate reporting would be required for MgSO4, MgO, and MgCl2. They are reported separately because they are separate, unique chemical substances. No reporting would be required of elemental magnesium in this scenario because elemental magnesium is not one of the substances manufactured.</p>

				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-47">
					<p>You should not rely solely on the SDS for determining compositional information for your imported chemical substances if better data are known or reasonably ascertainable. The SDS may not be the most reliable source of information for TSCA purposes; the SDS is not developed for purposes of providing complete chemical identity or formulation information and does not specify that the chemicals that are listed be identified following reporting requirements under TSCA. For example, an SDS for a mixed metal oxide-containing product may only list individual metal oxides (which are likely the reactants used to make the product) instead of the one or more mixed metal oxide compounds that would properly represent the manufactured metal oxide composition for TSCA purposes. In such cases, the most accurate and reasonable estimate would not come from the SDS itself, but from a consideration of the SDS and other known or reasonably ascertainable data.</p>

					<p>CDR reporting is based on all the information that is known or reasonably ascertainable to the importer. As an importer, you are responsible for certifying that the chemicals either comply with TSCA or that the chemicals are not subject to TSCA. EPA therefore believes that the importer generally knows the specific chemical identities of the chemical substances that it is importing. For additional information, see <a href="../compliance/compliance-guide-chemical-import-requirements-toxic-substances-control-act.html">EPA’s Compliance Guide for the Chemical Import Requirements of TSCA</a>.</p>

					<p>In some situations, the importer may rely on the foreign supplier to identify the chemicals and the correct certification for the imported chemical substances.  This may occur when the supplier considers the composition of its product to be a trade secret or confidential.  In this situation, the importer can ask the foreign supplier to provide the compositional information directly to EPA by initiating a<a href="2016-chemical-data-reporting-training-modules.html"> joint submission</a> with the foreign supplier.</p>

					<p>You should also consider information that you have, or that a reasonable person, similarly situated as you, might be expected to have.  For example, in your company it may be common practice to conduct testing to determine the concentration of ingredients in the formulated mixture.  In addition, it may be reasonable for you to obtain information from your supplier to clarify any composition or ranges indicated on the SDS or other documents. In some cases, the concentration value may remain as a range, even after you have assembled all the known or reasonably ascertainable information.  In such cases, you should report the most accurate and reasonable estimate that you can, based on all the information that is known or reasonably ascertainable to you.</p>

				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-48">
					<p>As an aid to importers, EPA is providing the following example list of reporting practices, which would be generally acceptable for purposes of reporting the production volumes of chemical substances in imported formulated products (i.e., assuming that the reporting practices are applied consistently and are not superseded or contradicted by some other better information that is known or reasonably ascertainable to the importer, such as test results, engineering, or process knowledge):</p>

					<ul><li>When an exact concentration is provided, use that value.*</li>
						<li>When an exact concentration is not available, check with the author of the SDS or the chemical supplier to inquire if a more accurate reporting value or range can be acquired.* Then use one of the following, as applicable:
							<ul><li>When only an upper bound concentration is provided (“less than or equal to 35%” or “35% max.”, for example), use that numerical value.</li>
								<li>When a concentration range with both an upper and lower bound is provided, reporting the arithmetic average of the lower and the upper bound. For example, if the foreign supplier states methanol is present in a concentration of not less than 20% and not more than 40%, reporting 30%.</li>
								<li>When only the lower bound concentration of the chemical substance is specified (“at least 60%” or “more than or equal to 60%” or “60% minimum”, for example) and the concentrations of all other components are given, use the following procedure:
									<ul><li>Subtract the other component values (as known discrete values, or your calculated arithmetic averages of ranges) from 100%.</li>
										<li>Treat the remaining percentage as the upper bound for the chemical substance. </li>
										<li>Determine the arithmetic average of the known lower bound and your calculated upper bound value.  </li>
									</ul></li>
							</ul></li>
					</ul><p>For example, the foreign supplier states that a mixture contains at least 10% ABC and 60% water. Subtracting the water portion of the compound from 100% leaves 40% as the upper bound for ABC. The arithmetic average between upper (40%) and lower (10%) bounds is 25%, the value EPA suggests you use in your calculation.</p>

					<ul><li>When only the lower bound is specified and no information on other components is given, use the following procedure: 
							<ul><li>Assume that the upper bound is 100% and</li>
								<li>Determine the arithmetic average of the known lower bound and 100%.</li>
							</ul></li>
					</ul><p>* Note that a formulated mixture is a combination of chemical substances, intentionally combined to form a product. On the other hand, a product represented as an impure chemical has a single chemical identity, and the impurities are not intended to impart desired characteristics for the chemical substance. If the composition information is really the percent purity information of a single chemical substance, then you should report the total production or import volume of the material that is described with a percent purity.  Include the purity percentage as Maximum Concentration in Block 2.B.11 of Form U.  Do not reduce the total PV by the percentage of the impurity.  For example, 100,000 lbs of a product described as 70% stearic acid, would be reported as an import of 100,000 lbs with a maximum concentration of 70%.  This is because the product is commercially considered stearic acid as a whole; the manufacturer is selling “stearic acid”, per se.</p>

					<ol><li>A mixture, composed of two or more fully identified chemical substances to be named and listed separately, or</li>
						<li>A reaction product, or combination of chemicals from a reaction, to be listed as a single chemical substance, using one name that collectively describes the products or, if that is not feasible, describes the reactants used to make the products. This type of byproduct is often identified as a single chemical substance using nomenclature for substances of Unknown or Variable composition, Complex reaction products and Biological materials (a “UVCB” substance) to represent what is often a process stream.<br />

This would be instead of treating the byproduct as a single UVCB chemical substance.  The manufacturing company should determine, based on the specific manufacturing scenario, whether the byproduct is more appropriately represented as a single well-defined chemical substance, a mixture of individual chemical substances or a UVCB chemical substance.</p>

					<p>Where a manufacturer reasonably concludes (after considering all the facts known and reasonably ascertainable) that the uncharacterized components of a byproduct will have no subsequent commercial purpose after they are manufactured, for CDR purposes the manufacturer may treat the byproduct as a mixture of the remaining characterized components.

				<div class="accordion-pane">
					<p>A byproduct may be reportable when it is manufactured for a commercial purpose. The definition of manufacture for commercial purposes at 40 CFR 704.3 includes: “…substances that are produced coincidentally during the manufacture, processing, use, or disposal of another substance or mixture, including both byproducts...”</p>

					<p>While byproducts may or may not, in themselves, have commercial value, they are nonetheless produced for the purpose of obtaining a commercial advantage because they are formed as part of the manufacture of a chemical product for a commercial purpose. Thus, chemical substances that are the byproducts of the manufacture, processing, use, or disposal of another chemical substance or mixture, like any other manufactured chemical substance, are subject to CDR reporting if they (1) are listed on the TSCA Inventory, (2) are not otherwise excluded from reporting, (3) are manufactured (including imported) in a volume of 25,000 pounds or more at a single site during any calendar year since the last principal reporting year, and (4) their manufacturers are not specifically exempted from CDR requirements. If the reporting threshold of 25,000 pounds is met or exceeded during any calendar year since the last principal reporting year, reporting is required for each calendar year in the CDR submission period. A byproduct may be subject to the lower 2,500 pound threshold if it is the subject of certain TSCA actions. See the <a href="../node/78969.html">Reporting Thresholds for 2016</a> fact sheet.</p>

					<p>A byproduct may have a separate commercial purpose even if its manufacturer does not intentionally commercialize it. If a manufacturer sends the byproduct to another person or site where it is used in such a manner that it has a commercial purpose, then the byproduct’s manufacturer is potentially required to report the byproduct for purposes of CDR.</p>

					<p>In most cases, a byproduct that is used for a commercial purpose is reportable; however, under 40 CFR 711.10(c), chemical substances are not subject to reporting when they meet the requirements of 40 CFR 720.30(g) or (h).</p>

				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-19">
					<p>Under 40 CFR 720.30(g) a byproduct is exempt from reporting if: “...its only commercial purpose is for use by public or private organizations that (1) burn it as a fuel, (2) dispose of it as a waste, including in a landfill or for enriching soil, or (3) extract component chemical substances from it for commercial purposes. (This exclusion only applies to the byproduct; it does not apply to the component substances extracted from the byproduct.)”</p>

					<p>In other words, when a byproduct is only burned as a fuel, disposed of as a waste material including disposal in a landfill or for enriching the soil, or used for extracting component chemical substances (or some combination thereof), the manufacture of that byproduct is not required to be reported for CDR purposes. In interpreting Section 40 CFR 720.30(g), one needs to consider the following important points:</p>

					<ul><li>Regarding 40 CFR 720.30(g)(1), note that where the same quantity of a byproduct is burned as a fuel, and is also being burned for a non-exempt commercial purpose (e.g., if the combustion residue is used as a process input), then the exemption under 40 CFR 720.30(g)(1) would not apply. However, if a certain portion of a byproduct was burned solely as a fuel and a separate portion of the byproduct was used for a non-exempt commercial purpose, the exemption under 40 CFR 720.30(g)(1) would apply to the portion burned solely as fuel (but not to the portion burned for the non-exempt purpose). Also note that if a substance is normally manufactured for use as a fuel, then it would not be considered a byproduct. Furthermore, if a byproduct were to end up being used as a fuel by individuals (such as in a consumer product), it would not qualify for this exemption (because 40 CFR 720.30(g)(1) only covers use by “public or private organizations”).</li>
						<li>Regarding 40 CFR 720.30(g)(2), note that although the manufacture of a byproduct is not reportable if the byproduct is subsequently disposed of as a waste for purposes of enriching the soil (e.g., to change the soil properties in a desirable way, such as by serving as a filler to make the soil less dense or enhancing moisture retention), a substance used as a fertilizer is not necessarily an excluded byproduct. For instance, if the substance’s ordinary manner of use is as a fertilizer, then the substance is not a byproduct in the first place, and the provisions at 40 CFR 720.30(g) are inapplicable.</li>
						<li>Regarding 40 CFR 720.30(g)(3), Note that a “component chemical substance” means a chemical substance that already specifically exists in the byproduct. While heat or chemical reactions can be used to extract a component chemical substance, the component chemical substance extracted must be left chemically unchanged by the extraction process for the byproduct manufacturer to claim a CDR exemption under 40 CFR 720.3(g)(3). That is, the chemical changes can only occur on substances other than the one being extracted. Note also that individual component chemical substances extracted from a UVCB byproduct are reportable substances if they are extracted for a commercial purpose, even in cases where the manufacture of the UVCB byproduct itself is exempt from reporting pursuant to 40 CFR 720.30(g)(3).</li>

Byproducts whose only commercial purpose is as a source from which component chemical substances are extracted are not subject to reporting for CDR, because they are exempt under 40 CFR 720.30(g)(3). What is meant by “extract a component chemical substance”?</a>
				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-20">
					<p>A component chemical substance is a chemical substance that is present in the byproduct prior to extraction. Heat or chemical reactions can only be used to extract a component chemical substance if the component substance extracted is being left chemically unchanged by the extraction process. Thus, for example, a chemical reaction could be employed on a byproduct to convert component Chemical Substance X into Chemical Substance Y, so as to facilitate the extraction of component Chemical Substance Z (which undergoes no chemical transformation) from the byproduct. However, if component Chemical Substance Z from the byproduct were first transformed into another chemical substance, and then that different chemical substance were extracted, the overall process would not qualify as extraction of a “component chemical substance.”</p>

					<p>Note that the exemption at 40 CFR 720.30(g)(3) only applies to the manufacture of the byproduct itself and does not apply to the manufacture of another chemical substance by extraction from a UVCB byproduct. Thus, regardless of whether the manufacturer of a UVCB byproduct receives the benefit of this exemption (determined in part by whether or not the byproduct is subsequently used to extract component chemical substances), the manufacture of a different chemical substance by extraction from the UVCB byproduct is subject to CDR.</p>

					<p>Note also that the component chemical substance must be viewed as a particular chemical substance.</p>

					<p>For instance, elemental Nickel (Ni0) and nickel hydroxide Ni(OH)2 have different molecular identities and are not the same chemical substance. Additionally, because the Ni+2 ion cannot exist on its own and is therefore not considered a chemical substance, the Ni+2 ion is not considered a component chemical substance of the byproduct. Consider the following scenarios:</p>

					<ul><li>Scenario 1: If (Ni0) is recovered from a UVCB byproduct containing Ni(OH)2 as a component chemical substance, then an extraction of a component chemical substance has NOT occurred. Rather, the byproduct has been used as a chemical feedstock to manufacture Ni<sup>0</sup>, and both the byproduct and (Ni0) are therefore subject to CDR.</li>
						<li>Scenario 2: If Ni(OH)2 is recovered from a UVCB byproduct containing Ni(OH)2 as a component chemical substance, then an extraction of a component chemical substance has occurred. Assuming the byproduct was not put to any other commercial purpose, the manufacture of the byproduct is exempt from reporting under CDR. The manufacture of the Ni(OH)2 is subject to CDR, as the extracted chemical itself does not qualify for the exemption at 40 CFR 720.30(g)(3) (the provision applies to the byproduct, not to the chemical substance extracted from the byproduct).</li>

				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-21">
					<p>Under 40 CFR 711.10(c) reporting is not required for those substances meeting the requirements of Sections 720.30(h), which says in part:</p>

					<p class="indented">The chemical substances described below: (Although they are manufactured for commercial purposes under the Act, they are not manufactured for distribution in commerce as chemical substances per se and have no commercial purpose separate from the substance, mixture, or article of which they are a part.)</p>

					<p class="indented">1. Any impurity.<br />
						2. Any byproduct which is not used for commercial purposes.<br />
						3. Any nonisolated intermediate.</p>

					<p>In interpreting Section 40 CFR 720.30(h)(1), (h)(2), and (h)(8), one needs to consider the following important points.</p>

					<ul class="indented"><li>Regarding 40 CFR 720.30(h)(1), note that the term impurity has a specific definition when determining reporting obligations under TSCA. Under 40 CFR 704.3, impurity means a chemical substance which is unintentionally present with another chemical substance. When considering how to characterize a separate byproduct stream, it is not proper to consider as an impurity a component of the byproduct stream that was created as part of the process that created the intended product and byproduct stream (Although the component was produced coincidentally with the intended product, it has been separated from the intended product. Thus, it is not “present with” the intended product and it is not “unintentionally present with” the byproduct stream). It may be proper, however, to consider as an impurity a substance that was introduced as an impurity as part of one of the raw materials used as an input to the process. If such an impurity reacts during the process, however, the result is a manufactured substance that does not meet the impurity definition when separated from the intended product into a byproduct stream.</li>
						<li>Regarding 40 CFR 720.30(h)(2), note that “commercial purpose” refers back to the broad definition in 40 CFR 704.3 (“the purpose of obtaining an immediate or eventual commercial advantage”). It is not synonymous with the narrower definition of “commercial use” at 40 CFR 711.3, which is only intended for further subcategorizing reportable uses (in Part III reporting) between industrial, commercial, and consumer settings.</li>
						<li>Regarding 40 CFR 720.30(h)(8), note that non-isolated intermediate means: ...any intermediate that is not intentionally removed from the equipment in which it is manufactured, including the reaction vessel in which it is manufactured, equipment which is ancillary to the reaction vessel, and any equipment through which the substance passes during a continuous flow process, but not including tanks or other vessels in which the substance is stored after its manufacture. Mechanical or gravity transfer through a closed system is not considered to be intentional removal, but storage or transfer to shipping containers ‘‘isolates’’ the substance by removing it from process equipment in which it is manufactured. (40 CFR 704.3).</li>
					</ul><p>Although 720.30(h) has descriptions of eight different types of chemical substances, the three listed above are the generally most relevant when considering reporting of byproducts under CDR.</p>

				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-22">
					<p>Not always. 40 CFR 720.30(h)(5) states: Any chemical substance which results from a chemical reaction that occurs upon end use of another chemical substance, mixture, or article such as an adhesive, paint, miscellaneous cleanser or other housekeeping product, fuel additive, water softening and treatment agent, photographic film, battery, match, or safety flare, and which is not itself manufactured or imported for distribution in commerce or for use as an intermediate.</p>

					<p>A chemical substance may qualify for the 40 CFR 720.30(h)(5) exemption if it is not manufactured or imported for distribution in commerce or for use as an intermediate. If it is to qualify for the 720.30(h)(5) exemption, a chemical substance cannot have a commercial purpose separate from the substance, mixture, or article of which it is a part. (See the introductory language of 40 CFR 720.30(h)). Therefore, where a used or spent catalyst is both a reaction product of the end use of a catalyst for commercial purposes and an intermediate in the manufacturing of fresh catalyst for commercial purposes, it would not qualify for the 720.30(h)(5) exemption.</p>

				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-23">
					<p>Probably not. The distinction between whether a byproduct is burned for energy recovery or incinerated solely for destruction is generally not relevant under the CDR. This is because the CDR exempts both byproducts whose “only commercial purpose” is for burning as a fuel (40 CFR 720.30(g)(1)), and byproducts that are “not used for commercial purposes” (40 CFR 720.30(h)(2)). This latter category would include incineration, solely for destruction. Note, though, that where a byproduct is burned for energy recovery, but that is not the only commercial purpose for the byproduct (e.g., if the combustion residue is used as a process input), then the exemption under 40 CFR 720.30(g)(1) would not apply. This exemption also does not apply if you have manufactured a coproduct and not a byproduct. For example, if a side product you manufacture is normally intended to be used as a fuel product, it would be considered a co-product instead of a byproduct.</p>

					<p>In the case of coproduct manufacture, there is commercial intent to produce the coproduct, separate from whatever commercial intent may concurrently exist to manufacture some other chemical substance or mixture.

				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-29">
					<p>Start by making sure you have properly chemically identified for TSCA purposes the precursor or impure chemical substance(s). Then compare the specific chemical identities of the precursor or impure chemical substance(s) and the finished chemical substance(s). Purification does not involve a change in chemical identity between the precursor/impure chemical substance and the purified chemical substance. By contrast, removing a chemical substance from a precursor chemical substance having a different chemical identity (for example, the extraction of a discrete chemical substance from a UVCB precursor) is manufacturing. See 40 CFR 711.3 (“[m]anufacture includes the extraction, for commercial purposes, of a component chemical substance from a previously existing chemical substance or complex combination of chemical substances.”)</p>

				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-30">
					<p>In general, when 80% pure Chemical A (correctly identified, for TSCA purposes, as that discrete substance and not as a UVCB substance) is purified to make 98% pure Chemical A, the activity does not constitute manufacturing of Chemical A, but it is considered to be processing of Chemical A for purposes of CDR and PMN reporting. The two batches of Chemical A differ only in their purity. For purposes of TSCA, they are considered to be the same chemical substance.</p>

					<p>Note that it is the original manufacturing of the 80% pure Chemical A that triggers reporting of Chemical A under CDR. Note also that the need to report any substance produced during the purification process may need to be addressed (e.g., the substance(s) removed from Chemical A may trigger reporting itself, depending upon the specific situation and the use of the removed substance(s)).</p>

				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-31">
					<p>For recycling or reclaiming, it is important to determine whether the resulting chemical substance has the same or different specific chemical identity as the starting material. If the starting and resulting substances are the same (e.g., a newly manufactured substance that one intends to make, such as salicylic acid, which is initially impure but then is purified), then the activity is considered to be processing and no manufacturing has occurred. If the resulting substance is different, for example, the extraction of cresol from “Phenols (petroleum)” [CASRN 64743-03-9], then the activity is considered to be manufacturing.</p>

				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-32">
					<p>Depending on your specific manufacturing scenario, Spent Solvent A may be appropriately characterized as a mixture or may be properly characterized as a UVCB substance.

					<ul style="list-style-type:none"><li>1.

At a site, an ore (e.g., bauxite) is refined to create a product (e.g., alumina). The ore contains another metal compound or salt, which is reduced to the elemental metal, removed from the product during processing, and disposed of as waste. Should the elemental form of this metal be reported under the CDR rule? If the elemental metal byproduct is sold for commercial use, is it subject to CDR reporting requirements?</a>
				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-33">
					<p>Reporting is not required if the metal byproduct from the refining is only disposed of as a waste. See 40 CFR 711.10(c) which references 40 CFR 720.30(g).</p>

					<p>Reporting is required if the elemental metal byproduct is used for commercial purposes, because neither the exemption provision at 40 CFR 720.30(g) nor the exemption provision at 40 CFR 720.30(h)(2) would apply to the manufacture of this byproduct metal. Because the byproduct metal is being used for a commercial purpose (other than the commercial purposes listed in 40 CFR 720.30(g)), you would evaluate the CDR reporting requirements for this substance (e.g., was the amount of the byproduct metal produced at a single site during any calendar year since the last principal reporting year 25,000 pounds or more?).</p>

My metal smelting process generates a large amount of dust, which is collected in a baghouse. Since this dust has a high metal content, we recycle the baghouse dust rather than disposing of it. Do I have any reporting obligations for this material?</a>
				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-34">
					<p>The baghouse dust is a byproduct of your manufacturing process. If you use it for a non-exempt commercial purpose, you would evaluate the CDR reporting requirements for the baghouse dust (e.g., was the amount of the baghouse dust produced at a single site during any calendar year since the last principal reporting year 25,000 pounds or more?).</p>

					<p>An example of using the baghouse dust for a non-exempt commercial purpose is to smelt the baghouse dust to produce a metal. The smelting process uses chemical reduction, a form of extractive metallurgy. A common mistake is to think that at high temperature the metal just melts out of the ore or baghouse dust. However, if you just heat up the ore without the proper reducing agent, you will just obtain molten ore. A metal obtained from baghouse dust by chemical reduction or smelting is manufactured using a chemical reaction, and cannot be considered to be a component chemical substance (so that the 40 CFR 720.30(g) exclusion from reporting would not apply). Both the baghouse dust and the metal produced by the smelting process are subject to reporting under the CDR.</p>

Do I have any reporting obligations for the collection of the unreacted starting materials into the baghouse?</a>
				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-35">
					<p>EPA does not consider the mere recapture of unreacted starting materials to constitute manufacturing. Therefore, in this situation, reporting under CDR would not be required on the capture of unreacted starting material in the baghouse. Note, though, that if the baghouse dust were to include other components, such as partially reacted intermediates or other substances from a chemical reaction, the baghouse dust may be a byproduct that you are manufacturing. If you use baghouse dust byproduct for a non-exempt commercial purpose after manufacturing it, you would need to evaluate your CDR requirements as a manufacturer of the baghouse dust.</p>

				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-36">
					<p>Chemical X could be described as an impurity because it is unintentionally present with Chemical Y, but it would be more accurate to describe it as a byproduct because it is manufactured without a separate commercial purpose. The manufacture of this byproduct/impurity is not reportable for CDR purposes. See 40 CFR 711.10(c) and 40 CFR 720.30(h)(1).</p>

					<p>However, if a manufactured chemical substance that remained with the primary product did have a separate commercial purpose – for instance, if it improved the performance of the primary product or provided a primary property to the commercial product – it would be a coproduct, not an impurity or a byproduct, and its manufacture would be reportable for CDR purposes.</p>

The paper pulping process involves a recycling loop for the pulping chemicals. The spent pulping liquors (also called black liquor) is a byproduct of the pulping process. The black liquor is burned to produce power, and the resulting smelt is recovered to begin the process to make white liquor. Since the black liquor is used as a fuel, do I need to report it under the CDR? How about the smelt?</a>
				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-37">
					<p>Both the manufacture of the black liquor byproduct and the manufacture of smelt from the black liquor byproduct are reportable under CDR.</p>

					<p>40 CFR 720.30(g) exempts the manufacture of a byproduct from CDR reporting if: “…its only commercial purpose is for use by public or private organizations that (1) burn it as a fuel, (2) dispose of it as a waste, including in a landfill or for enriching soil, or (3) extract component chemical substances from it for commercial purposes. (This exclusion only applies to the byproduct; it does not apply to the component substances extracted from the byproduct.)”</p>

					<p>While the black liquor is burned, the volume is burned both for its fuel value and for its value as a feedstock to the production of smelt. The example indicates that the manufactured smelt is then put to non-exempt commercial purposes (to make white liquor, a pulping chemical). Therefore, it is not the case that the only commercial purpose of the black liquor is to “burn it as a fuel.” 40 CFR 720.30(g) therefore does not provide an exemption for the manufacture of the black liquor byproduct.</p>

Our company purchases a cation resin (H+-Resin) for our ion exchange system from a domestic supplier. The ion-exchange resin is used to remove dissolved Metal G from a liquid process stream, which contains metal G in the form of a metal cation. Following removal of the G+ metal ions, the remainder of the liquid process stream is disposed as a waste. The metal ion is subsequently displaced from the ion-exchange resin by the addition of an acid solution and further processed on-site to recover Metal G. Which reaction products should our company report under CDR?</a>
				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-38">
					<p>EPA assumes that the liquid process stream is the company’s own byproduct. Also, based on the information provided, EPA assumes that the following reactions occur within the ion exchange system:</p>

					<code>Ion Exchange: [G+][anions-] + [H+][Resin] ⇌ [G+][Resin] + [H+][anions-];</code>

					<code>(where the particular anions balancing G+ in the liquid process stream are assumed to be</code>

					<code>unknown or of variable composition)</code>

					<code>and</code>

					<code>Regeneration: [G+][Resin] + [H+][Y-] ⇌ [G+][Y-] + [H+][Resin];</code>

					<code>Where Y- is a known anion.</code>

					

					<p>As the liquid process stream passes through a cation resin, H+ cations on the resin are exchanged for G+ cations via chemical absorption (forming a [G+][Resin] complex). As the performance of the resin declines, an acid solution ([H+][Y-]) is typically used to regenerate the cation resin. A subsequent drying step results in the metal salt [G+][Y-]. The metal salt is subsequently chemically reduced to form elemental metal G.</p>

					<p>From this set of reactions, EPA has determined (assuming that all pertinent production volumes thresholds are exceeded) that CDR reporting requirements apply to the company as follows:</p>

					<p>Liquid Process Stream: Since the stream contains unknown or variable salts of G+, and there is not a basis to conclude that these various salts would necessarily be exempt from CDR if they were treated as mixture components, it is appropriate to treat the entire liquid process stream as a single UVCB chemical substance. The process stream has a non-exempt commercial purpose (the production of [G+][Resin]) and is subject to CDR. The manufacture of the liquid process stream does not receive the reporting exemption at 40 CFR 720.30(g)(3) because the component chemical substances at issue ([G+][anions-]) are not extracted from the stream. Rather, they are chemically reacted with [H+][Resin] to produce [G+][Resin].</p>

					<p>Metal-Depleted Liquid Process Stream: This liquid, which remains after formation of the [G+][Resin], is a byproduct of the chemical processing of the original liquid process stream. The metal-depleted liquid process stream (including [H+][anions-] and other constituents) has no commercial purpose except to be disposed as a waste and it is exempt from reporting under 40 CFR 720.30(g)(2).</p>

					<p>Metal-Resin Complex: Reporting requirements for the metal-resin complex should be evaluated by each manufacturer. If the process is one of continuous formation of the [G+][Resin] complex and regeneration of the [H+][Resin], the metal-resin complex satisfies the definition of a non- isolated intermediate and is exempt from CDR reporting requirements (see 40 CFR 711.10(c) which references 720.30(h)(8)). However, if the [G+][Resin] complex is stored in the ion- exchange column, such as during periods when the ion exchange system is not in use, the metal- resin complex would not be a non-isolated intermediate. Alternatively, if the [G+}[Resin] complex is described as a polymer on the TSCA Inventory and meets the criteria of the CDR polymer definition, it is exempted from reporting (see 40 CFR 711.6(a)(1)).</p>

					<p>Regenerated Cation Resin: The regenerated ion-exchange resin ([H+][Resin]) is an insoluble matrix fabricated from an organic polymer substrate, often polystyrene. Many polymers on the TSCA Inventory are exempt from CDR because they meet the criteria of 40 CFR 711.6(a)(1).</p>

					<p>Metal Salt: The regeneration process forms a metal salt, [G+][Y-]. This salt is manufactured for a non-exempt commercial purpose and is subject to CDR reporting requirements.</p>

					<p>Metal G: The recovery of Metal G from the metal salt requires a chemical reduction process. This involves the chemical conversion of one chemical substance (the metal salt [G+][Y-]) into a different chemical substance: elemental G. The manufacture of elemental G from [G+][Y-] is subject to reporting.</p>
