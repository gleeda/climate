		<ul class="accordion"><li><a class="accordion-title" href="completing-form-u.html#pane-87" title="Click to expand description">23.1. What do I need to do differently now that the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act has become law?</a>

				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-87">
					<p>If you submit a CBI claim, you will need to agree to the new certification statement which appears in the reporting system. As in the past, the certification statement must be electronically signed and dated by an authorized official at the company. The authorized official typically is a senior official with management responsibility for the person (or persons) completing the form.</p>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li><a class="accordion-title" href="completing-form-u.html#pane-1" title="Click to expand description">23.2. Does a whole new Form U need to be completed for each chemical substance?</a>
				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-1">
					<p>No. Only one Form U is submitted for a site; all reportable chemicals for a site are reported on a single Form U. The certification statement and Part I are completed once for a Form U, regardless of the number of chemical substances reported. Parts II and III are completed for each chemical substance, and Part IV is only completed in the special case of a joint submission.</p>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li><a class="accordion-title" href="completing-form-u.html#pane-2" title="Click to expand description">23.3. Can one Form U be submitted for the same chemical substance used at two different sites?</a>
				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-2">
					<p>No. You must submit a separate Form U for each site for which you are required to report. Therefore, in cases where you have two separate sites manufacturing the same chemical substance, you must prepare separate Form Us for each site.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-3">
					<p>The certification statement applies to all the information supplied on the Form U and should be signed only after the form has been completed. The CDR submission must be certified, indicating that the submitted information has been completed in compliance with the CDR requirements and that any confidentiality claims are true and correct. The new law requires the addition of specific language. On June 24th, 2016, the certification statement was updated to include the required language to conform with the new law and is now:</p>

					<p>I hereby certify to the best of my knowledge and belief that all information entered on this form is complete and accurate.</p>

					<p>I further certify that, pursuant to 15 U.S.C. § 2613(c), for all claims for protection for any confidential information made with this submission, all information submitted to substantiate such claims is true and correct, and that it is true and correct that the person submitting the claim has:</p>

					<p>(i) taken reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality of the information;<br />
						(ii) determined that the information is not required to be disclosed or otherwise made available to the public under any other Federal law;<br />
						(iii) a reasonable basis to conclude that disclosure of the information is likely to cause substantial harm to my competitive position; and<br />
						(iv) a reasonable basis to believe that the information is not readily discoverable through reverse engineering. 15 U.S.C. 2613(c).</p>

					<p>Any knowing and willful misrepresentation is subject to criminal penalty pursuant to 18 USC § 1001.</p>

					<p>The certification statement must be electronically signed and dated by an authorized official at the company. The authorized official typically is a senior official with management responsibility for the person (or persons) completing the form.</p>

The person previously responsible for this reporting is no longer working here and we cannot locate the user ID and password to gain access to our previous chemical reporting information on e-CDRweb. How do I gain access to earlier reported data? Can you reset the passphrase to grant me access?</a>
				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-84">
					<p>To access previous chemical reporting information for a company, you must be registered in EPA’s Central Data Exchange (CDX) with your own username and password and know the eCDRweb passphrase. If in CDX you register for the exact same organizations (same Organization ID) and exact same facilities (same facility ID) as your predecessor, you will be able to see what forms were previously created and submitted.</p>

					<p>In the event the original passphrase has been lost, the information on the form U itself will not be electronically accessible. However, you can request a paper copy of the previously submitted information.</p>

					<p>To request a copy of your site’s 2012 CDR Form U, please submit a notarized request on company letterhead to EPA. The company letterhead must be from the company that owns the site. The request must include the name and address of the site of the desired Form U and a statement certifying you are authorized to receive this potentially confidential information.</p>

		<h3>24. “Known to or Reasonably Ascertainable by” Reporting Standard</h3>

		<ul class="accordion"><li><a class="accordion-title" href="completing-form-u.html#pane-5" title="Click to expand description">24.1. Please provide further clarification on the scope of what would be required under the “known to or reasonably ascertainable by” reporting standard. How would this reporting standard apply to processing and use information? How does this standard differ from the “not readily obtainable standard,” previously applicable to such reporting? Does the change of standard indicate that “extensive file searches and customer surveys” are now expected of submitters in order to assemble data for the purposes of chemical data reporting?</a>

				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-5">
					<p>The term “known to or reasonably ascertainable by” is defined at 40 CFR 704.3. It means “all information in a person’s possession or control, plus all information that a reasonable person similarly situated might be expected to possess, control, or know.” By contrast, “readily obtainable” information does not even cover all the information in a submitter’s possession or control. As defined for the 2006 IUR, it was limited to what was known by certain “management and supervisory employees of the submitter.” See 68 FR 879 (2003).</p>

					<p>Under the “known to” portion of the standard, a submitter must therefore ascertain what it knows about the processing and use of a chemical substance it manufactures (including imports), without confining its inquiry to what is known to managerial and supervisory employees. A submitter would also be expected to review other information which the manufacturer (including importer) may have in its possession. This standard requires that submitters conduct a reasonable inquiry within the full scope of their organization (not just the information known to managerial or supervisory employees). The inquiry would be as extensive as a reasonable person, similarly situated, might be expected to perform within the organization. Information derived from customer surveys or other customer contacts, like any other information, would be “known to” the submitter if it is available after a reasonable inquiry within the organization. The standard does not necessarily require that the manufacturer conduct an exhaustive survey of all employees.</p>

					<p>Inquiry under the “reasonably ascertainable” portion of standard may also entail inquiries outside the organization to fill gaps in the submitter’s knowledge. Note however, that if particular information cannot be derived or reasonably estimated without conducting further customer surveys (i.e., without sending a comprehensive set of identical questions to multiple customers), it would not be “reasonably ascertainable” to the submitter. Thus there is not a need to conduct new customer surveys for purposes of the CDR. As described above, however, existing customer survey data may nevertheless be “known to” the organization.</p>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li><a class="accordion-title" href="completing-form-u.html#pane-6" title="Click to expand description">24.2. What are some examples of types of information that are considered to be in a person’s possession or control or that a reasonable person similarly situation might be expected to possess, control, or know?</a>
				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-6">
					<p>Information could be possessed by employees or other agents of the company reporting under the CDR rule, including persons involved in the research, development, manufacturing, or marketing of a chemical substance. This information includes knowledge gained through discussions, symposia, and technical publications. Other examples include:</p>

					<ul><li>Files maintained by the submitter or employees in the submitter’s company, such as marketing studies, sales reports, or customer surveys;</li>
						<li>Information contained in standard references, such as MSDSs, that contain use information or concentrations of chemical substances in mixtures; and</li>
						<li>Identification numbers from the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) and from Dun &amp; Bradstreet.</li>

		<h3>25. Part I – Company and Site Identification Information</h3>

		

		<h4 class="indented">Section A. Parent Company Information (Blocks 1.A.1-1.A.8)</h4>

		<ul class="accordion"><li><a class="accordion-title" href="completing-form-u.html#pane-7" title="Click to expand description">25.1. Can EPA clarify how the responsibility will be assigned for reporting chemical substance manufacture and import activities for entities that were acquired or divested since the last submission period? For example, the current owner of a newly acquired facility may not have access to manufacture/import volume information for years before they acquired the facility. Would exemptions be provided for any company engaged in an acquisition or divestiture during the years since the last reporting cycle?</a>

				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-7">
					<p>Reporting should be based on ownership of the manufacturing entity, as of the date that the report is submitted. EPA acknowledges that there will be submitters who have been involved in an acquisition or divestiture since the last submission period and for whom certain information is not known or reasonably ascertainable. If information is not known or reasonably ascertainable, it need not be reported under the CDR. See the <a href="../node/85231.html">Reporting After Changes to Company Ownership or Legal Identity</a> fact sheet for further information.</p>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li><a class="accordion-title" href="completing-form-u.html#pane-8" title="Click to expand description">25.2. During the first six months of the current CDR reporting year (e.g., 2015), Company X manufactured 30,000 pounds of a chemical substance included on the TSCA Inventory and not otherwise excluded from the CDR at a particular site. In the middle of the same year, Company Y purchased Company X, acquiring all the assets of Company X and assuming all of the liabilities of Company X. During the last six months of the same year, Company Y manufactured 40,000 pounds of the same chemical substance at the site. Who should report the amounts of the chemical substance manufactured?</a>
				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-8">
					<p>Because all of the assets and liabilities of Company X were merged into Company Y, and Company Y continued as a going concern, Company Y is required to report the entire 70,000 pounds of the chemical substance manufactured at the site during the reporting year (e.g., 2015), as well as the production volume of the chemical substance during any year since the last principal reporting year. More information about the effect of company mergers on CDR reporting can be found in the <a href="../node/85231.html">Reporting After Changes to Company Ownership or Legal Identity</a> fact sheet.</p>

			<li><a class="accordion-title" href="completing-form-u.html#pane-9" title="Click to expand description">25.3. On January 1, 2016, Company A will sell the portion of its business that conducted manufacturing in 2015. Company B will purchase this portion of the business, acquiring all of its assets and assuming all of its liabilities. Whose company identification should be reported for the “U.S. parent company”? Company A’s because Company A was the owner when the manufacturing occurred? Or Company B’s because Company B was the owner of the submission?</a>
				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-9">
					<p>By the time of the CDR submission in 2016, Company B owns the entity that conducted the manufacturing in 2015. Company B should report its own identity, not the identity of a previous owner. More information about the effect of the sale of a company on reporting requirements can be found in the <a href="../node/85231.html">Reporting After Changes to Company Ownership or Legal Identity</a> fact sheet on the CDR website.</p>

A company has 3 small facilities (1 chemical substance to report) that closed during the CDR submission period and the company cannot reasonably obtain the manufacturing data for the facilities. How should the company complete the form for these facilities?</a>
				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-10">
					<p>Assuming each of the facilities met or exceeded the production volume threshold for the subject chemical substance during any calendar year since the last reporting period, the company should submit a Form U for each of the closed facilities and report the CDR information to the extent that it is known to or reasonably ascertainable by the company. Additional information about the effect of ceasing manufacturing operations at a site on CDR reporting can be found in the <a href="../node/85231.html">Reporting After Changes to Company Ownership or Legal Identity</a> fact sheet on the CDR website.</p>

Company CDE has a D&amp;B number for its headquarters at another location but not for the solely owned part of the Texas site. Does Company CDE need to get a site-specific D&amp;B number for the part of the Texas site that it solely owns? Do the two entities need to do separate reporting for the site, one for the jointly owned part and one for the solely owned part?</a>
				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-12">
					<p>In this description, Company CDE and CDE Texas are separate corporate entities. Therefore, the land on which these companies manufacture chemical substances is composed of two distinct sites, one owned solely by Company CDE and a second jointly owned by Company CDE and CDE Texas. Company CDE may use its corporate D&amp;B number to report the chemical substances on the part of the site that it owns alone. Because CDE Texas is a distinct corporate entity, it seems appropriate that this entity should have a distinct D&amp;B. For chemical substances manufactured by the joint venture on the jointly owned part of the site, it would seem appropriate to use the D&amp;B number for CDE Texas, as the site is also its headquarters.</p>

However, companies may use their discretion in selecting a technical contact or multiple technical contacts, as provided by the e-CDRweb reporting tool. Submitters should consider, in selecting the technical contact, that EPA may have follow-up questions about a CDR submission one or more years after the submission date.

				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-22">
					<p>While companies are allowed to use their discretion in selecting a technical contact or multiple technical contacts, as permitted by the e-CDRweb reporting tool, EPA expects a technical contact to be someone who can answer detailed follow-up questions that EPA may have regarding the Form U. EPA has found that technical contacts not at the reporting site generally are less knowledgeable about the chemical substance or the types of information needed for the Form U and therefore may not be able to discuss follow-up questions. Also, it has been EPA’s general experience that short-term contractors have not been suitable technical contacts because they may no longer be under contract with the submitting company a year or more after the Form U is submitted when EPA may want to contact them.</p>

		<ul class="accordion"><li><a class="accordion-title" href="completing-form-u.html#pane-25" title="Click to expand description">26.1. How does a submitter determine the Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number (CASRN) for a chemical substance and what if the submitter can’t find it?</a>

				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-25">
					<p>Submitters must use the <a href="https://iaspub.epa.gov/sor_internet/registry/substreg/home/overview/home.do">Agency’s Substance Registry Services (SRS)</a> to report the chemical substance identification information consisting of the currently correct Chemical Abstracts (CA) Index Name and the correct corresponding Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) Registry Number (CASRN). The SRS is EPA’s central system for information about chemical substances that are tracked or regulated by EPA or other sources. It is the authoritative resource for basic information about chemicals, biological organisms, and other chemical substances of interest to EPA and its state and tribal partners. However, submitters of Inventory-listed substances should generally know already what CASRNs have been assigned to their substances.</p>

					<p>Submitters will be able to connect directly to the SRS database from the e-CDRweb reporting tool to report the correct CA Index Names and CASRNs for all non-confidential chemical substances on the TSCA Inventory. TSCA Accession Numbers and generic chemical names will be listed in the SRS for chemical substances on the confidential portion of the TSCA Inventory. The use of the SRS to obtain the identities for all CDR reportable chemical substances is a convenient way to meet the chemical nomenclature requirement and will help to prevent errors in the reporting of chemical identification information for the CDR.</p>

					<p>Every non-confidential chemical substance reported in accordance with CDR must be accompanied by its correct CASRN, corresponding to the chemical substance’s correct, specific chemical name. (40 CFR 711.15(b)(3)(i)). Submitters may enter either a CASRN (Block 2.A.2) or the specific name of the chemical substance (Block 2.A.4) to select the appropriate CASRN/Chemical Abstracts (CA) Index Name combination from the SRS database. To report a substance on the confidential Inventory, the TSCA Accession Number must be submitted as the chemical identifying number.</p>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li><a class="accordion-title" href="completing-form-u.html#pane-26" title="Click to expand description">26.2. If the substance is confidential, can the Accession Number or the PMN case number be used instead?</a>
				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-26">
					<p>In the case of confidential chemical substances, EPA is requiring that submitters report only the TSCA Accession Number as a chemical identifying number. If the PMN case number of a confidential substance was used for reporting in the past, submitters can use the PMN case number to search the SRS to populate the pertinent chemical identification information for the confidential chemical substance listed on the TSCA Inventory.</p>

					<p>The SRS contains a cross-reference list that displays the Accession Number, generic chemical name, and the PMN case number (or for an initial TSCA Inventory substance, the TSCA Inventory reporting form number) for any confidential chemical substance listed on the TSCA Inventory. Submitters can use the SRS to select the correct Accession Number corresponding to the confidential chemical substance intended to be reported (the generic name corresponding to the Accession Number will automatically be incorporated into the report).</p>

					<p>EPA recognizes that there are certain circumstances where a submitter occasionally may not be sure of the particular PMN case number and Accession Number that EPA has assigned to one of its confidential chemical substances so that they do not have enough information to search the SRS. This could happen, for example, if the chemical substance were originally reported as part of a consolidated PMN and a submitter did not learn from EPA which particular case number in the consolidated PMN number sequence corresponds to which of the several reported confidential chemical substances. This could also happen if a certain PMN represented a mixture of two or more confidential chemical substances, such that multiple Accession Numbers were assigned to the different chemical substances reported in that single PMN, and a submitter didn’t already request the particular Accession Numbers from EPA for the individual chemical substances comprising that multi-component type of PMN.</p>

					<p>Submitters who are not able to identify the Accession Number by searching the SRS should contact EPA, in writing or via fax on company letterhead, well before initiating CDR reporting to obtain the Accession Number assigned when the Notice of Commencement (NOC) was submitted to the Agency. Individuals are urged to submit a complete and accurate TSCA Inventory Correspondence via fax or by U.S. mail at least one month before the submission deadline. Note that incomplete and/or inaccurate requests may be rejected. The Agency will respond to such inquiries in as timely a manner as possible. It is the responsibility of the submitter to contact the Agency for such information in sufficient time to allow for the Agency to respond.</p>

However, the CASRNs that the company previously used to report these products are not listed as partially exempt. The table below shows the CASRNs previously used in reporting by the company as compared to the CASRNS of molecularly similar partially exempt petroleum process streams.</a>

							</tr></tbody></table><p><strong>The company wants to know whether or not these CASRNs would be considered synonyms and if they can use the CASRNs for the partially exempt process streams for their CDR submission.</strong></p>

					<p>The CASRNs listed above for the partially exempt petroleum process streams are for Class 2 substances, which are combinations of possible hydrocarbons with the chain lengths in the ranges indicated. Such Class 2 substances are not intended to encompass Class 1 substances, which can be more precisely described with a specific chemical structure and molecular formula. For example, the substance identified above as butane is not considered the same substance as "Hydrocarbons, C4-5," even though it falls within the C4 to C5 range, because butane is a more precise description of the substance as it was actually manufactured, and "Hydrocarbons, C4-5" is considered to be a combination of possible hydrocarbons (not limited to alkanes) in the C4 to C5 carbon number range. A company should use the CAS number that is the best fit for the chemical substance being manufactured or imported and is consistent with how the substance is accurately described in commerce and was reported by the company for TSCA Inventory purposes. In this case, the correct CAS number for butane is 106-97-8. This substance is not partially exempt from CDR.</p>

					<p>EPA expects that use of SRS to identify chemical substances and their correct CASRNs will help improve the accuracy of identification. In the example above, a search of “butane” or “106-97-8” gives two results: one for 106-97-8 and another for 68476-85-7. The systematic name for CASRN 68476-85-7 is “petroleum gases, liquefied” which also is listed in the table at 40 CFR 711.6(b)(1) as partially exempt from CDR reporting. However, in the SRS section titled “Associated Identifiers”, CASRN 106-97-8 is listed as an incorrectly used CAS number. None of the CASRNs that the company previously used list the partially exempt CASRNs as synonyms and vice versa.</p>

				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-49">
					<p>It depends on what is meant by sending “questions to customers.” Submitters need not send out a comprehensive set of identical questions to multiple customers in order to fulfill the CDR/s reporting standard. That is, they need not conduct a new survey of their customers. However, fulfilling the reporting standard may entail inquiries outside the organization (e.g., contacting a major customer or examining that customer’s public website) to fill in gaps in the submitter’s knowledge, where the submitter’s current knowledge is less than what a “reasonable person similarly situated might be expected to possess, control, or know.” See 40 CFR 704.3.</p>

For Part III, should the company provide information about consumer and children’s uses even if its chemical substance is not the end use product?</a>
				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-50">
					<p>Yes. If the chemical substance is used in a consumer product, the company would still report the information, even if the company does not manufacture the end use item. The information provided in Part III is associated with the processing and use of chemical substances and typically relates to processing or use that is outside of the manufacturing or importing site, unless, of course, the manufacturer or importer also processes or uses the chemical substance. The codes that a company selects for Part III relate to what subsequent users and processors are doing with the product.</p>

					<p>Information on subsequent industrial users and processors is reported on Part III, Section A, and on commercial and consumer uses of the chemical substance would be reported on Part III, Section B of CDR Form U to the extent the information is known to or reasonably ascertainable by the manufacturer or importer of the subject chemical substance. A company which is a manufacturer or importer should report information about the distribution and use of the chemical substance known to or reasonably ascertainable by the company.

					<p>Manufacturers of such fungible commodities should report based on intended distribution. For example, if a submitter produces 100,000 tons of ammonia that is transported via a pipeline in common with ammonia produced by other manufacturers to various distribution points along the pipeline, a submitter should, for CDR purposes, consider this site’s 100,000 tons to have only been extracted from the pipeline by its customer. Thus, the submitter does not have to account for all potential downstream processing and use scenarios for all persons drawing ammonia from the common pipeline. Instead, the submitter should provide processing and use information based on the premise that the 100,000 tons of ammonia that it injected into the pipeline is the same 100,000 tons of ammonia withdrawn from the pipeline by its intended customer.</p>

Is there a minimum duration of exposure that does not need to be reported (e.g., one minute)? </a>
				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-68">
					<p>Under the CDR rule, there is no minimum duration or frequency of exposure for determining the number of workers reasonably likely to be exposed to a chemical substance. If it is determined that a worker is reasonably likely to be exposed at any time during the year for any length of time, this worker should be included in the estimate.</p>

				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-70">
					<p>Do not report full-time equivalents. EPA requires that the total number of individuals reasonably likely to be exposed to each reportable chemical substance be reported (40 CFR 711.15(b)(3)(vii) and 40 CFR 711.15(b)(4)(i)(F)). When a site employs temporary, seasonal, or contract workers in the manufacture of a reportable chemical substance, those workers should be included in the number of workers reasonably likely to be exposed if they work in areas where the chemical substance is manufactured. Those employees whose jobs are not associated with potential exposures to a chemical substance or mixture (e.g., administrative staff who never enter areas where the chemical substance is manufactured and persons working elsewhere on site who are not reasonably anticipated to be exposed to the chemical substance for even a brief period of time) should not be included in the reported number of workers reasonably likely to be exposed to a chemical substance.</p>

			</li>
			<li><a class="accordion-title" href="completing-form-u.html#pane-71" title="Click to expand description">29.5. Should administrative staff be included in the estimate for number of workers?</a>
				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-71">
					<p>There may be instances in which administrative staff working at the site are reasonably likely to be exposed to the chemical substance and thus should be included in the number of workers reported. However, if the administrative workers do not enter areas where the chemical substances are manufactured and are not reasonably likely to be exposed to a chemical substance for even a brief period of time, they should not be counted among the number of workers.</p>

			<li><a class="accordion-title" href="completing-form-u.html#pane-72" title="Click to expand description">29.6. A company knows that a chemical substance that it manufactures and processes is present in the air in non-manufacturing areas of the plant site at measurable concentrations. How should the company estimate the number of workers reasonably likely to be exposed to the chemical substance? Are all workers employed at the site reasonably likely to be exposed?</a>
				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-72">
					<p>The CDR regulation requires the reporting of the number of workers reasonably likely to be exposed to a reportable chemical substance (40 CFR 711.15(b) (3)(vi) and 40 CFR 711.15(b)(4)(i)(F)). There is no minimum level of exposure to a chemical substance for CDR below which a worker need not be counted among the number reasonably likely to be exposed to a chemical substance. Therefore, if a company knows that a chemical substance manufactured at the site is present in the air throughout the site, all workers at the site must be included in the number of workers reasonably likely to be exposed to the chemical substance.</p>

			<li><a class="accordion-title" href="completing-form-u.html#pane-73" title="Click to expand description">29.7. Why are engineering controls and personal protective equipment (PPE) not considered when estimating the number of workers reasonably likely to be exposed?</a>
				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-73">
					<p>Engineering controls and personal protective equipment (PPE) may reduce but do not preclude exposure to a chemical substance. Examples of engineering controls include ventilation systems, nitrogen blankets, and dust collectors. Examples of PPE include chemical gloves, respirators, goggles, and protective clothing. Based on EPA’s experience, the definition and use of engineering controls and PPE varies from site to site. In addition, the effectiveness of engineering controls and PPE is limited by possible equipment malfunction and improper use. When reporting the number of workers reasonably likely to be exposed to a chemical substance, no allowance should be made for the possible protection provided by engineering controls and PPE.</p>

				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-74">
					<p>No. Workers that may be exposed during accidental releases should not be included in the number of workers reasonably likely to be exposed to a chemical substance. Only workers reasonably likely to be exposed to a chemical substance during normal manufacturing, processing, and use of a chemical substance, as well as ancillary activities such as equipment cleaning and maintenance, must be included for CDR.</p>

		<ul class="accordion"><li><a class="accordion-title" href="completing-form-u.html#pane-75" title="Click to expand description">29.9. Is the number of workers estimated for the facility or the customers?</a>

				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-75">
					<p>It depends on which section of Form U is being completed. Form U requires separate estimates for three different types of workers. For Part II information, a company only reports the number of workers associated with the site of manufacture and/or import identified in Part I. Part II covers activities at the site of manufacture or import and so the number of workers reasonably expected to be exposed at that site would be reported in Block 2.B.10.</p>

					<p>For Part III information, a company reports the number of workers associated with industrial processing and use as well as commercial use, whether it is the reporting company’s site or someone else’s. Part III covers not only processing and use activities that may occur at the site of manufacture and import, but also those activities that occur downstream at customers’ sites after the product leaves the site of manufacture or import. Therefore, the number of workers that are reasonably likely to be exposed to the chemical substance would be reported for each combination of type of process or use operation, industrial sector and industrial function category identified in Section 3.A. This would include workers at sites controlled by the manufacturer or importers as well as workers at sites not under the control of the manufacturer or importer. Likewise, the number of commercial workers reasonably likely to be exposed while using the chemical substance would be reported for each product category identified in Section 3.B.</p>

				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-76">
					<p>For an imported chemical substance, the site reported in CDR is the site of the operating unit within the organization of the person reporting which is directly responsible for importing the substance and which controls the import transaction; however, this may not be where the chemical substance is received. If the imported chemical substance is never physically received at the reported site, then no workers at that site are exposed to the chemical substance and the code, W1 would be reported in Part II, Block 2.B.10 for less than 10 workers reasonably likely to be exposed to the chemical substance.</p>

How does this company fill in Part II Block 2.B.10 for the range of workers likely to be exposed to the chemical substance?</a>
				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-77">
					<p>If the imported chemical substance is physically received at the reporting site, then workers at that site may be reasonably likely to be exposed to a chemical substance, regardless of their employer. Workers engaged in the loading of chemicals into transportation vessels, including trucks, may be reasonably likely to be exposed to a chemical substance during loading. If workers, including persons working for other companies, are reasonably likely to be exposed to the reported chemical substance at the site of manufacture (or import), then they should be included among those reported by Company A in Part II, Block 2.B.10 on Form U.</p>

How should Company B report the number of workers reasonably likely to be exposed during the manufacturing of Chemical X?</a>
				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-78">
					<p>Because any of the 12 workers may have worked on the Chemical X production line during the reporting year, Company B should report code W2 in Part II, Block 2.B.10 to reflect at least 10 but fewer than 25 workers.</p>

		<ul class="accordion"><li><a class="accordion-title" href="completing-form-u.html#pane-80" title="Click to expand description">30.1. When are joint submissions allowed?</a>

				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-80">
					<p>Joint submissions are allowed only where a supplier will not disclose to the manufacturer (including importer) the specific chemical name of the imported chemical substance or of a reactant used to manufacture the chemical substance, because the supplier claims the specific chemical name is confidential. This may happen, for instance, when a company is importing a mixture under a trade name, and the foreign manufacturer refuses to reveal the chemical identity of a confidential component of the mixture. In this case, the importer and the supplier can jointly report the information through a joint submission. The importer must ask the supplier of the confidential chemical substance to directly provide EPA with the correct chemical identity in Part IV of Form U (see 40 CFR 711.15(b)(3)(i)(A)).</p>

					<p>This may also happen in the event a manufacturer cannot provide the entire chemical identity of a chemical substance it manufactures because the chemical substance is manufactured using a reactant having a specific chemical identity that the reactant supplier claims as confidential and will not reveal to the manufacturer. In this case, the manufacturer and the supplier of the reactant can jointly report the information through a joint submission. The manufacturer must submit a report directly to EPA containing all information he or she knows or can reasonably ascertain about the chemical identity. Furthermore, the manufacturer must also ask the reactant supplier to directly provide to EPA the correct chemical identity of the confidential reactant in Part IV of Form U (see 40 CFR 711.15(b)(3)(i)(B)).</p>

					<p>Because signatures are required by each party of a joint submission, secondary submitters who wish to report must each register with CDX, and complete their own sections of the same Form U report. The reporting tool will match both submissions based upon the unique ID number sent by the manufacturer (including importer) to notify the supplier of the partial CDR submission. Suppliers do not have access to any of the information submitted to EPA by the manufacturers (including importers), unless the manufacturers provide it directly to the suppliers. Likewise, the manufacturers (including importers) cannot see the information that the suppliers report to EPA. This way, the confidentiality of information for all submitters is protected. The information provided by both submitters will be combined and processed as one joint submission once they are received by EPA.</p>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li><a class="accordion-title" href="completing-form-u.html#pane-81" title="Click to expand description">30.2. As a company generally has no contractual means to require foreign suppliers of already purchased materials to either register with CDX or file a joint submission electronically, what can the company do to ensure that a foreign supplier prepares a secondary submission?</a>
				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-81">
					<p>The joint submission requirement is to properly ask that suppliers provide secondary submissions to EPA. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the domestic company, the primary submitter, to ask the foreign company, the secondary submitter, to complete Part IV of Form U and send the information to EPA by the end of the submission period. It is also the responsibility of the primary submitter to include a copy of the request to the secondary submitter with the portion of the Form U that the primary submitter sends to EPA. (See 40 CFR 711.15(b)(3)(i)(B)).</p>

			<li><a class="accordion-title" href="completing-form-u.html#pane-82" title="Click to expand description">30.3. How will the manufacturer’s information be matched with the foreign supplier’s information if they are filing separately?</a>
				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-82">
					<p>After the manufacturer (including importer), acting as a Primary Submitter, fills in the trade name or other proprietary identifier in the “Chemical Identification” section of the “Joint Submission Report”, the primary submitter will use instructions in a box labeled “Unique Identifier for Joint Submission” to send an e-mail with a unique ID number and language to notify the supplier, acting as secondary submitter for the partial CDR submission containing information for the trade name product. The ID number will be used to link the joint reports in an internal database after the secondary submitter reports the correct chemical identity information to EPA by completing Part IV of Form U.</p>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li><a class="accordion-title" href="completing-form-u.html#pane-83" title="Click to expand description">30.4. A company plans, as a primary submitter, to submit a joint submission with the supplier of a mixture the company imports. Although the company knows the chemical identity of the chemical substances used in the mixture, the supplier has asked that the identity be kept confidential. In this case, does the company submit a joint submission using the trade name instead of using the chemical name?</a>
				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-83">
					<p>No. Joint submissions are used only in cases when a supplier will not disclose to the submitter the specific chemical identity of the imported TSCA Inventory chemical substance or a reactant used to manufacture the TSCA Inventory chemical substance because the name is claimed confidential. If a manufacturer (including importer) actually knows or can reasonably ascertain the chemical identity (e.g., the CASRN or Accession Number) of a chemical substance subject to CDR, the manufacturer (including importer) must provide that information irrespective of a supplier’s confidentiality claims.</p>

					<p>If the manufacturer (including importer) as primary submitter wishes to claim the chemical identity as confidential, the chemical substance must be listed on the confidential portion of the TSCA Inventory, in which case the submitter must check the confidential business information (CBI) box and provide the appropriate upfront substantiation. The substantiation question at 40 CFR 711.30(b)(1)(i) accommodates consideration of harm to the submitter’s competitive position “or to your supplier’s competitive position.</p>
